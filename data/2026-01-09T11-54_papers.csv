0,Communicating complex statistical models to a public health audience: translating science into action with the FARSI approach,2025,"M Stival, L Schiavon, G Bertarelli, S Campostrini","arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.06787, 2025",https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=ddki-foAAAAJ&pagesize=100&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=ddki-foAAAAJ:M3ejUd6NZC8C,,10.21203/rs.3.rs-6403583/v1,https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6403583/v1,"Mattia Stival, Lorenzo Schiavon, Gaia Bertarelli, Stefano Campostrini",,2025,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,posted-content,"Abstract Background . Effectively communicating complex statistical model outputs is a major challenge in public health. This study introduces the FARSI approach (Fast, Accessible, Reliable, Secure, Informative) as a framework to enhance the translation of intricate statistical findings into actionable insights for policymakers and stakeholders. We apply this framework in a real-world case study on chronic disease monitoring in Italy. Methods . The FARSI framework outlines key principles for developing user-friendly tools that improve the translation of statistical results. We applied these principles to create an open-access web application using R Shiny, designed to communicate chronic disease prevalence estimates from a Bayesian spatio-temporal logistic model. The case study highlights the importance of an intuitive design for fast accessibility, validated data and expert feedback for reliability, aggregated data for security, and insights into prevalence population subgroups, which were previously unobservable, for informativeness. Results . The web application enables stakeholders to explore disease prevalence across populations and geographical area through dynamic visualizations. It facilitates public health monitoring by, for instance, identifying disparities at the local level and assessing risk factors such as smoking. Its user-friendly interface enhances accessibility, making statistical findings more actionable. Conclusions . The FARSI framework provides a structured approach to improving the communication of complex research findings. By making statistical models more accessible and interpretable, it supports evidence-based decision-making in public health and increases the societal impact of research.",Lorenzo Schiavon,SCHLNZ94M18G224Q

We derive their properties and propose a strategy to set their tuning parameters (which depend on $ m $) automatically, with a view to making the whole approach simple to use. We develop our methods for the specific functions $ f(x)=\log x $ and $ f(x)=1/x $, as they arise in several statistical applications such as maximum likelihood estimation of latent variable models and Bayesian inference for unnormalized models.

This process typically involves two key phases: (i) identifying the words associated with language concepts, and (ii) clustering documents that share similar word distributions. In this study, motivated by the growing interest in automatic categorisation of policy documents and regulations, we leverage recent advancements in Bayesian factor models to develop a novel topic modelling approach. This enable us to represent the high-dimensional space defined by all possible observed words through a small set of latent variables, and simultaneously cluster the documents based on their distributions over these latent constructs. Here, groups and underlying constructs are interpreted as document topics and language concepts, respectively, with the number of dimensions not required in advance. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using synthetic data, providing a comparison with existing methods in the literature. The illustration of our approach on a corpus of Italian health public plans unveils intriguing patterns concerning the semantic structures used in ageing policies and document topic similarities.",Lorenzo Schiavon,SCHLNZ94M18G224Q

Its rarity and lack of risk factors often delay diagnosis. Case presentation: The patient was a 34-year-old pregnant Italian woman, presenting with severe osteoporosis related to pregnancy and lactation. The patient presented for the first time at the Outpatient clinic of the Rehabilitation Unit in the Department of Public Health at the University of Federico II, Naples in March 2024, exhibiting severe symptoms indicative of osteoporosis, along with acute lower back pain. During the anamnesis, it was revealed that the patient was unable to bend forward, with reduced flexion and extension movements. The symptoms began during the third trimester. Management and diagnosis: In terms of diagnosis, clinical exams were conducted to confirm the disease. The MRI exam showed fractures and vertebral variations, with significant findings including calcification. Additionally, DXA indicated lower values compared to normal Treatment included: breastfeeding cessation, correction of calcium and vitamin D deficiencies, and bisphosphonate injection therapy. It is noteworthy that the rehabilitative approach has been recommended throughout pharmacological treatment and especially upon its suspension. Ultimately, the primary cause of this condition was pregnancy as bone resorption increases during pregnancy. Outcome: Following clodronate treatment completion, the patient showed full clinical recovery and significant radiological improvement. Follow-up DXA one year after diagnosis revealed normalized bone density and the patient had gained autonomy in activities of daily living with no further symptoms.",ANTONIO PICONE,PCNNTN84M09F839T

These surveys gather information on the health status of individual respondents, including details on their behaviours, risk factors, and relevant socio-demographic information. While the collected data provides valuable information, modelling such data presents several challenges. For instance, in health risk models, it is essential to consider behavioural information, local and temporal dynamics, and disease co-occurrence. In response to these challenges, our work proposes a multivariate temporal logistic model for chronic disease diagnoses at local level. Linear predictors are modelled using individual risk factor covariates and a latent individual propensity to diseases. Leveraging a state space formulation of the model, we construct a framework in which temporal heterogeneity in regression coefficients is informed by exogenous information at local level, corresponding to different contextual risk factors that may affect the occurrence of chronic diseases in different ways. To explore the effectiveness of our method, we analyse behavioural and risk factor surveillance data collected in Italy (PASSI), which is well-known as a country characterized by high peculiar administrative, social and territorial diversities reflected on high variability in morbidity among population subgroups.",Lorenzo Schiavon,SCHLNZ94M18G224Q

Smart environments and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies offer promising solutions by integrating intelligent systems that adapt to users’ needs. However, personalizing or reconfiguring living spaces to accommodate AAL technologies requires a multidisciplinary approach that considers health conditions, assistive devices, and spatial constraints. This study presents the Age-It Decision Support System (DSS), a tool designed to assist architects and designers in selecting and integrating AAL solutions into domestic environments. The DSS leverages an ontological framework to model individual health conditions, environmental constraints, and assistive technologies, enabling a structured decision-making process. By incorporating a knowledge-based reasoning system, the DSS suggests user-centered and suitable modifications and device placements while ensuring compatibility with the physical space. The system communicates with Autodesk Revit, allowing seamless data exchange through XML-based file processing. This enables early-stage simulations of AAL device integration, facilitating collaborative decision-making among designers, healthcare professionals, and end users. A case study demonstrates the DSS’s effectiveness in recommending assistive solutions for a user with reduced mobility, considering spatial constraints and usability factors. Future developments aim to enhance the ontology with a broader range of health conditions and assistive devices, improving its robustness and usability in real-world applications. The proposed DSS represents a significant step toward personalized and adaptive home environments, fostering independent living and improving the quality of life for older adults.",Daniele Spoladore,SPLDNL86B12I625E

In this context, ontologies offer a promising approach to represent and manage knowledge about built environments, smart technologies, and user needs—especially within Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems. This paper presents a systematic literature review examining the role of ontologies in the reconfiguration of domestic living spaces, with a focus on their application in design processes and decision support systems. Following the PRISMA methodology, 14 relevant works published between 2000 and 2025 were identified and analyzed. The review explores key aspects such as ontology conceptualization, reuse, engineering methodologies, integration with CAD systems, and validation practices. The results show that research on this topic is fragmented yet growing, with the first contribution dated 2005 and peaks in 2016, 2018, and 2024. Most works (11) were conference papers, with Europe leading the contributions, particularly Italy. Half of the reviewed ontologies were developed “from scratch”, while the rest relied on conceptualizations such as BIM. Ontology reuse was inconsistent: only 50% of works reused existing models (e.g., SAREF, SOSA, BOT, ifcOWL), and few adopted Ontology Design Patterns. While 11 works followed ontology engineering methodologies—mostly custom or established methods such as Methontology or NeOn—stakeholder collaboration was reported in less than 36% of cases. Validation practices were weak: only six studies presented use cases or demonstrators. Integration with CAD systems remains at a prototypical stage, primarily through semantic enrichment and SWRL-based reasoning layers. Remaining gaps include poor ontology accessibility (few provide URLs or W3IDs), limited FAIR compliance, and scarce modeling of end-user needs, despite their relevance for AAL solutions. The review highlights opportunities for collaborative, human-centered ontology development aligned with architectural and medical standards to enable scalable, interoperable, and user-driven reconfiguration of domestic environments.",Daniele Spoladore,SPLDNL86B12I625E

To manage the path-dependency induced by the asset value process, we apply a procedure recalling the forward shooting grid method. Hence, we discretize the asset evolution by constructing a grid made up of a limited number of representative buckets at each time step. For each bucket in the grid, we establish a binomial dynamics to identify the successors at the next observation epoch. Since the grid is composed by representative buckets, it may occur that successors do not appear in the grid. In these cases, we invoke interpolation techniques to proceed backward on the grid and compute the derivative price at inception.

While the smart home is the chosen scenario for such technologies, a variety of environments could potentially benefit from the synergies between IoT and digital applications. Among them, the clinical waiting rooms is an environment facing several challenges, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical waiting rooms are crowded places associated with stress and anxiety, often linked to patients’ idling time. Nonetheless, the rise of IoT-enabled telehealth has focused attention on the possibility of changing the functions of clinical waiting rooms. In this work, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify the existing solutions for “smart waiting rooms”. The review process started with 278 works, and it identified 16 papers relevant to the topic of smart clinical waiting rooms. Moreover, the results of this review underlined that waiting rooms are a neglected research area that could take advantage of IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance patients’ experience and support the diagnostic process. Leveraging the research directions identified in the review process, this work proposes a “Smart Waiting Room” that exploits virtual reality (VR), AI, and IoT technologies to support the diagnostic process (via a cognitive assessment) and the personalization of the patient’s context—taking into account the features of the physical environment.

These adverse effects have to do with time use restrictions because of the time priority required by caregiving. Caregivers often cut on labour market involvement, sleeping, and social activities and relationships they previously enjoyed. Despite extensive research, the socioeconomic disparities in caregiver experiences remain underexplored. For example, more disadvantaged individuals could suffer the most from caregiving, having limited possibilities to ‘buy time for themselves’ by purchasing services on the market. Our study, using data from the Survey of Health, Aging, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE, 2020), investigates how health shocks to partners (i.e., exogenous shocks leading to increasing demands for informal caregiving, such as the onset of dementia, hip fracture, stroke) influence caregivers’ daily activities; and how socioeconomic characteristics moderate this relationship. Preliminary results show that care responsibilities influence the caregiver’s time expenditure, with heterogeneity across gender and socio-economic status. The most affected by a partner’s health shock are men at the bottom of the income distribution and women at the top. When having an impaired partner, the former spend more time in household chores and cut on leisure activities, while the latter sleep less at night and cut on paid work. In conclusion, it is essential to understand which individuals face the consequences of caregiving and reiterate the importance of a social infrastructure supporting families caring for their dependent family members.",FRANCESCA ZANASI,ZNSFNC90P53F257N

Flexibility relies on the ability of the model to manage different specifications of the correlated processes governing interest rate, mortality, and fund dynamics, thus allowing the insurer to make the most appropriate choices. The model is also able to handle additional guarantees like a surrender opportunity for which explicit formulae are not available being it similar to an American derivative. The model discretizes mortality and interest rate dynamics through two different binomial lattices and then combines them into a bivariate tree characterized by the presence of four branches for each node. The probability of each branch is defined to replicate the correlation affecting the two processes. The bivariate model is useful to compute the value of survival zero coupon bond. When adding another source of risk, such as the fund dynamics for evaluating fund-linked insurance products, we model it through a bivariate tree that captures the influence of the interest rate on its drift term. Then, the mortality risk is embedded by defining a trivariate tree presenting eight branches emanating from each node with probabilities defined in order to capture the correlations of the processes. Extensive numerical experiments assess the model accuracy by considering some stylized policies, but the model application is not limited to them being it able to manage different contract specifications.",Emilio  Russo,RSSMLE79H20D086B

This study presents a straightforward methodology for engineering cell-material interfaces on semicrystalline poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) films. Our approach leverages thermomechanical treatments to precisely control the surface presentation of cell-adhesive arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides. By employing a solvent casting technique, followed by controlled thermal annealing, we successfully fabricated PCL films exhibiting a range of crystallinity levels. This variation in crystallinity allowed for the fine-tuned modulation of RGD peptide density across the PCL surfaces, spanning from 25 to 70 nmol/cm<sup>2</sup>, achieved through consistent aminolysis reaction conditions. Subsequent application of uniaxial stretching induced anisotropic reorientation of these peptides, effectively generating surfaces with defined biochemical patterns capable of directing cellular adhesion, morphology, and orientation. Our results reveal that the surface density of RGD peptides exerts a significant influence on cell behavior measured through the focal adhesion assembly, which is crucial for cell-material interaction and signaling. Furthermore, the peptide density and orientation significantly impacted the cell migration directionality. Through quantitative analysis of cell trajectories obtained via time-lapse microscopy, we demonstrated the ability of these patterned biochemical signals to effectively guide cellular motility along predetermined paths. These findings emphasize the importance of ligand spacing and the synergistic interplay between biochemical and topographical cues in cell-material interactions. Importantly, the developed method is straightforward and highly reproducible with the flexibility to reset and redefine the surface patterns. While primarily conceived as a fundamental approach, it holds potential for scalability and industrial translation thanks to the relatively simple processing of PCL compared to other biopolymers.",Vincenzo Lettera,LTTVCN82L19F839P

In the last decade, several methods for the recovery and valorization of these wastes were developed, mainly focused on the extraction of collagen using chemical methods. The extracted collagen, due to its poor quality, is mostly used in agriculture as a nitrogen source ingredient of fertilizers. This study aims to apply collagen, extracted from leather tanned solid wastes using a recently reported new process based on enzymatic hydrolysis, as filling agent for low quality leather. Thanks to the enzymatic hydrolysis, collagen can be extracted without affecting its integrity and, therefore, its quality. In order to use the extracted collagen as filler for low quality leather, an enzymatic mediated cross-linking reaction between collagen and casein was developed. The enzymatic cross-linking reaction was added as an additional phase of the re-tanning process or as a replacement of one of the re-tanning steps. To evaluate the filling effect, thickness of the treated leather was measured and infrared and microscopy analyses were performed, comparing the new methods to the traditional standard one. The mechanical properties of the filled leather were tested and the sensorial features, such as fullness and touch feelings, were estimated through a panel test. Results suggest the high potential of extracted collagen to be employed back in leather processing both as additive and as substitutive filler.",Vincenzo Lettera,LTTVCN82L19F839P

According to Kaptein's Corporate Ethical Virtues (CEV) model, this organizational ability is favored by the development of seven key corporate virtues (Clarity, Congruency, Feasibility, Supportability, Transparency, Discussability, and Sanctionability). The paper intends to connect the CEV model with sustainability reporting, which is taking on increasing relevance today due to factors such as the European Union's recent Directives on corporate non‐financial communication. In particular, the paper's objective is to examine to what extent and the way in which the virtues of the model have a role in sustainability reporting. Furthermore, this goal is enriched with an added focus, which is attention paid to actions taken by companies, and expressed in their sustainability reporting, in implementing virtuous behavior amidst the difficulties triggered by the COVID‐19 crisis. To achieve its aim, the paper presents and discusses a study of the role of the CEV model within two large companies in the logistics sector, through a content analysis of their sustainability reports covering the period 2018–2020 complemented by information from their corporate websites. The results of the analysis highlight both an overall relevance of the virtues included in the CEV model and the role of measures adopted by organizations to cope with COVID‐19 as a significant component of their sustainability performance in the pandemic period.

Previous studies show that mortality decreases by increasing income. In Italy, studies at a national level are missing. This study aims to investigate inequalities in mortality by income in Italy. Methods The analysis is based on the integration of the National Population Register (comprising the resident population as of Dec 31, 2018, and deaths in 2019) and the Income Statistical Register (representing perceived income during 2018). This integration enabled the availability of information on age, sex, residence, education, income, and vital status at the individual level for 13 million people aged 65 or above. Individuals were categorized according to their individual disposable income quintiles both before and after disability benefits. Inequalities by income are assessed by mortality rate ratios (MRR) estimated using negative binomial regression models controlling for demographic and socioeconomic features. The study is carried out within the Next Gen EU-funded project “Age-It Ageing well in an ageing society” (PE0000015), NRRF, M4.C2, Intervention 1.3. Results Considering income net of disability benefits, lower income levels are associated with higher mortality rates compared to the highest income level, for both sexes. Inequalities are more marked for men. The highest excess was observed for individuals with the lowest income (male MRR=1.65, 95%CI: 1.6-1.71; female MRR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.38-1.48). The excess decreases with increasing income. Conclusions The observed relationships between income and mortality are crucial for targeting policies to reduce health inequalities and promote the well-being of the elderly, the goal of which should be to improve access to social and health care and develop supportive policies for the most disadvantaged people. Further research will be devoted to the use of household income for individuals. Key messages • For the elderly, lower income levels are associated with higher mortality, with wider disparities in men. • The choice of definition of income is essential for an accurate assessment of the association between income and mortality.",Isabella  Siciliani,SCLSLL68H59G942X

The induction of therapy-induced senescence by anticancer drugs is known, but how senescent tumor cells influence the tumor immune landscape, particularly neutrophil activity, is still unclear. In this study, we investigate the induction of cellular senescence in breast cancer cells and the subsequent immunomodulatory effects on neutrophils using the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which is approved for the treatment of breast cancer and is under intense investigation for additional malignancies. Our research demonstrates that palbociclib induces a reversible form of senescence endowed with an inflammatory secretome capable of recruiting and activating neutrophils, in part through the action of interleukin-8 and acute-phase serum amyloid A1. The activation of neutrophils is accompanied by the release of neutrophil extracellular trap and the phagocytic removal of senescent tumor cells. These findings may be relevant for the success of cancer therapy as neutrophils, and neutrophil-driven inflammation can differently affect tumor progression. Our results reveal that neutrophils, as already demonstrated for macrophages and natural killer cells, can be recruited and engaged by senescent tumor cells to participate in their clearance. Understanding the interplay between senescent cells and neutrophils may lead to innovative strategies to cope with chronic or tumor-associated inflammation.",MATTIA LAFFRANCHI,LFFMTT90R30B157T

This study explores a radar-based approach for recognizing the activities of daily living in a bathroom setting, utilizing a BGT60TR13C Xensiv 60 GHz radar, manufactured by Infineon Technologies AG (Munich, Germany, EU), to classify human movements without capturing identifiable biometric features. A dataset was collected from seven volunteers performing ten activities which are part of daily living, including activities unique to bathroom environments, such as face washing, teeth brushing, dressing/undressing, and resting on the toilet seat. Deep learning models based on pre-trained feature extractors combined with bidirectional long short-term memory networks were employed for classification. Among the 16 pre-trained networks evaluated, DenseNet201 achieved the highest overall accuracy (97.02%), followed by ResNet50 (94.57%), with the classification accuracy varying by activity. The results highlight the feasibility of Doppler radar-based human activity recognition in privacy-sensitive settings, demonstrating strong recognition performance for most activities while identifying lying down and getting up as more challenging cases due to their motion similarity.

In preclinical research, multiple measurement methods are often combined to enhance reliability, but standardization remains challenging. To improve measurement robustness, we previously developed a composite strength score (SS5) that integrates five different grip strength tests into a single variable. While SS5 provides a comprehensive evaluation, its implementation is time‐consuming, limiting feasibility in large‐scale studies. In this study, we also examine two simplified composite scores, SS2 and SS3, as potential streamlined alternatives. Additionally, although normalizing grip strength to body weight is widely used, its appropriateness in geriatric mouse models has never been formally validated. Methods Forelimb grip strength was assessed in a cohort of 160‐aged C57BL/6J mice using five methods: Weight Lift Tests (Deacon protocol with sponge weights and a modified version with metal wire weights), the Cage Lift Test and the Grip Strength Meter (trapeze bar and grid). Additionally, a cross‐sectional group of 173 mice was analysed to assess the correlation between grip strength and muscle size. Each method was evaluated for its correlation with age, ability to detect sex differences, variability and association with muscle size. Results All methods strongly correlated with age (−0.518 ≤ r s ≤ −0.306). The Grip Strength Meter (trapeze bar) and modified Deacon method were the most effective in detecting sex differences ( p s ≤ 0.332), the modified Deacon method and Grip Strength Meter showed the strongest associations. The mean coefficient of variation (CV%) ranged from 7% to 17%, demonstrating good repeatability. Notably, despite being widely used, normalization of grip strength to body weight was found to introduce bias in geriatric mice, as age‐related weight loss distorts strength assessments. Absolute values proved to be a more reliable measure. To improve efficiency while maintaining reliability, we developed two new composite scores (SS2 and SS3) by integrating a subset of methods from SS5. These scores preserved the strong correlation with age observed in SS5 while reducing the number of required tests, enhancing feasibility. Conclusions Combining multiple grip strength assessments improves measurement reliability in aging studies. The newly proposed SS2 and SS3 scores provide a streamlined yet robust alternative to SS5, improving standardization and facilitating future comparisons in preclinical sarcopenia research. Our findings also challenge the routine normalization of grip strength to body weight in geriatric mice, emphasizing the importance of using absolute values to avoid bias.",Marco Malavolta,MLVMRC71H26A271V

It is responsible for CSF secretion and clearance, contains macrophages, and is one of the few sites within the central nervous system (CNS) where T cells are present. Additionally, the ChP plays a role in detecting peripheral inflammation, which leads to the modulation of its epithelial cell function. Despite its critical importance in maintaining brain homeostasis, the ChP is often overlooked, particularly concerning the changes it undergoes with aging, such as reduced barrier function, impaired CSF production, and altered immunosurveillance. These age-related alterations may contribute to several harmful effects, including neuroinflammation and oxidative damage, potentially predisposing individuals to neurodegenerative conditions. Although knowledge is still limited, gut dysbiosis and decreased Klotho levels—of which the ChP is one of the main sources—appear to be significant contributors to ChP impairments. This narrative review will examine the impact of age-related gut dysbiosis on the CNS, focusing on the ChP, and explore the effects of reduced Klotho levels in this brain structure. We will also propose the hypothesis that combining the administration of probiotics capable of restoring gut microbiota eubiosis with gene therapy to upregulate Klotho in the ChP could help preserve the structural and functional integrity of the aging brain. Finally, we will provide a technical overview to ensure that vectors encoding Klotho cDNA achieve maximum specificity for the ChP, thereby avoiding off-target effects.

Using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), and biophysical methods, we here characterized intermediate amyloid fibrils of αS forming during the aggregation from liquid-like spherical condensates to mature amyloids adopting the structure of pathologically observed aggregates. These transient amyloid intermediates, which induce significant levels of cytotoxicity when incubated with neuronal cells, were found to be stabilized by a small core in an antiparallel β-sheet conformation, with a disordered N-terminal region of the protein remaining available to mediate membrane binding. In contrast, mature amyloids that subsequently appear during the aggregation showed different structural and biological properties, including low levels of cytotoxicity, a rearranged structured core embedding also the N-terminal region, and a reduced propensity to interact with the membrane. The characterization of these two fibrillar forms of αS, and the use of antibodies and designed mutants, enabled us to clarify the role of critical structural elements endowing intermediate amyloid species with the ability to interact with membranes and induce cytotoxicity.",Alessandra Bigi,BGILSN90E63A390R

We used an online platform that reproduces a social media newsfeed and presented the nudge as a message when entering the platform. Our findings indicate that nudges making descriptive norms salient selectively increase participants' overall engagement with relatively harmless content.

One of the central strategies for managing public health throughout the pandemic has been through persuasive messaging and collective behavior change. To help scholars better understand the social and moral psychology behind public health behavior, we present a dataset comprising of 51,404 individuals from 69 countries. This dataset was collected for the International Collaboration on Social Moral Psychology of COVID-19 project (ICSMP COVID-19). This social science survey invited participants around the world to complete a series of individual differences and public health attitudes about COVID-19 during an early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (between April and June 2020). The survey included seven broad categories of questions: COVID-19 beliefs and compliance behaviours; identity and social attitudes; ideology; health and well-being; moral beliefs and motivation; personality traits; and demographic variables. We report both raw and cleaned data, along with all survey materials, data visualisations, and psychometric evaluations of key variables.",Tatiana  Celadin,CLDTTN93D47F382Q

Here we provide evidence for the effectiveness of ratings of news sources, instead of individual news articles. In a large pre-registered experiment with quota-sampled Americans, we find that participants are less likely to share false headlines (and more discerning of true versus false headlines) when 1-to-5 star trustworthiness ratings were applied to news headlines. This is true both when the ratings are generated by fact-checkers and by laypeople (although the effect is stronger using fact-checker ratings). We also observe a positive spillover effect: sharing discernment also increases for headlines whose source was not rated, likely because the presence of ratings on some headlines prompts users to reflect on source quality more generally. This study suggests that displaying information regarding the trustworthiness of news sources provides a scalable approach for reducing the spread of low-quality information.",Tatiana  Celadin,CLDTTN93D47F382Q

Despite all the efforts to emphasize the relevance of preventive measures, not everyone adhered to them. Thus, learning more about the characteristics determining attitudinal and behavioral responses to the pandemic is crucial to improving future interventions. In this study, we applied machine learning on the multi-national data collected by the International Collaboration on the Social and Moral Psychology of COVID-19 (N = 51,404) to test the predictive efficacy of constructs from social, moral, cognitive, and personality psychology, as well as socio-demographic factors, in the attitudinal and behavioral responses to the pandemic. The results point to several valuable insights. Internalized moral identity provided the most consistent predictive contribution—individuals perceiving moral traits as central to their self-concept reported higher adherence to preventive measures. Similar was found for morality as cooperation, symbolized moral identity, self-control, open-mindedness, collective narcissism, while the inverse relationship was evident for the endorsement of conspiracy theories. However, we also found a non-negligible variability in the explained variance and predictive contributions with respect to macro-level factors such as the pandemic stage or cultural region. Overall, the results underscore the importance of morality-related and contextual factors in understanding adherence to public health recommendations during the pandemic.",Tatiana  Celadin,CLDTTN93D47F382Q

This study investigates the extent of the support for FGM/C conditioned on its medicalization among migrant women from FGM/C-practising countries residing in Italy, and the characteristics of women supporting the practice. Data are from a national survey on FGM/C conducted in Italy in 2016, covering a representative sample of 1,378 women aged 18 + who were born in Nigeria, Egypt, Eritrea, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Somalia, and Ivory Coast. A discrete choice framework and a multinomial probit choice model are adopted to analyze women’s preferences about FGM/C continuation and medicalization. Findings indicate that, compared with women who support the practice unconditionally, the requirement of medicalization correlates with higher educational level, age, being in a couple, and being from a country where FGM/C is more commonly medicalized. Perceived benefits linked to increased support for FGM/C medicalization include religious approval, better marriage prospects, cleanliness, and conformity to traditional cultural values. Our data show that higher education is a critical, but not unique, factor in understanding the support for FGM/C in its medicalized form.",Patrizia  Farina,FRNPRZ59A64F704L

These problems and inequalities are particularly evident for women living in developing countries and for migrant women, and may be exacerbated by the effects of the current COVID-19 crisis.&#13;\n&#13;\nEmpowering women is a goal as well as a promoter of development. It can lead women to participate in social and political life; it can promote their effective involvement and lead to equal opportunities in the labor market. This can have a noteworthy impact on health, ensuring better care, social protection and promotion, universal access to sexual and reproductive health, as well as the reduction of harmful practices such as forced marriage and female genital mutilation/cutting. It can also lead to reduce all forms of violence against women and girls in the private and public sphere, thus decreasing the impact of violence.

We used a newly developed quantitative food frequency questionnaire to obtain an estimation of the intake of mercury through seafood consumption in a sample of 32 individuals from Trieste. Then, we validated the results obtained from the questionnaire against those of the analysis of total mercury measured in the hair of the same individuals through Spearman rank correlation coefficients, Cohen’s weighted Kappa statistic, and a Bland–Altman plot. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Cohen’s weighted Kappa statistic were 0.76 and 0.69, respectively. In the Bland–Altman plot, 93.75% of the data points lay within the acceptability range. The plot revealed an ever-increasing overestimation of mercury intake by the questionnaires as the hair mercury increased. By applying a standardized filtering procedure to the results of the questionnaires, we obtained a Spearman rank correlation coefficient and Cohen’s weighted Kappa statistic of 0.69 and 0.57, respectively. In this Bland–Altman plot, 93.75% of the data points lay within the acceptability range. In this latter plot, the proportionality between the mean difference and the magnitude of the measurement was more subtle compared to that observed in the plot built upon the non-filtered questionnaires.

This chapter aims to delve into the problems and issues that empathy, as a psychological mechanism enabling us to share others’ emotions, has. Before doing so, one must define what empathy means and contrast it with other related concepts often conflated with it. Once the definitional issues have been clarified (although certainly not solved), the chapter will focus on how an excess of empathy can lead a person to lose themselves and to burn out and on empathy’s intrinsic limitations. The former is particularly relevant in health care settings, although it is also a general issue, and the latter has to do with the biases and partialities that empathy always incorporates. Finally, the chapter will consider whether regulating empathy can solve its problems.",Sarah Songhorian,SNGSRH87A47F205O

Since its inception, extensive research has focused on exploring the factors influencing and outcomes associated with PsyCap within organizational contexts. Consequently, there has been a growing demand for reliable assessment tools to measure PsyCap accurately. The present multi‐study investigation aimed to examine whether the two main measures of Psychological Capital, namely the Psychological Capital Questionnaire and the Implicit‐Psychological Capital Questionnaire, show convergence in measuring the same underlying construct. In Study 1, using data from 327 employees from whom we obtained both self‐ and coworker reports on both explicit and implicit Psychological Capital, we evaluated the degree of convergence between measures using a Multitrait‐Multimethod approach. In Study 2, we used six‐wave longitudinal data from 354 employees, gathered every week for 6 consecutive weeks, to test a series of STARTS models, to decompose the proportions of variance of all the components (i.e., trait, state and error) of both Psychological Capital measures, and to compare their magnitude and similarity. In this second study, we also compared their longitudinal predictive power with respect to important organizational outcomes (i.e., work engagement and emotional exhaustion). All in all, results provided empirical evidence for the high degree of convergence of explicit and implicit measures of Psychological Capital.

The CRT measures the ability of a person to resist giving an immediate response that is intuitive but incorrect in favor of greater reflection to find out the correct answer. We have two treatments: a Time Pressure (TP) treatment (provide an answer within 30 s) and a Time Delay (TD) treatment (provide an answer after 60 s). We find that TD increases the frequency of correct answers, while TP increases the frequency of incorrect answers, especially incorrect answers that are not intuitive. Moreover, we confirm the existence of gender biases as already found in other studies. In particular, gender moderates the effects of the experimental treatments: TD increases the frequency of correct answers for males but not for females, while TP increases the frequency of incorrect but less intuitive answers for females but not for males.

They claim that we have direct access to the mentality of others through the perception of their expressions (§§1-2). And yet, a few issues might render DP's grounds unsteady (§3). To avoid such risk, a more detailed account of how bodily expressions are perceivable can be of help. Our goal is not that of proposing an alternative to the current accounts of DP, but to explore an element of the latter that has been taken for granted: the perceptibility of expressions per se. Our thesis is that bodily expressions are a subset of gestalt structures. To account for this, we deal with what gestalts are (§4.1) and we investigate whether their features can be found in bodily expressions (§4.2). If bodily expressions are a subset of gestalt structures, then they are directly perceived and not inferred from their elements. We claim that conceiving bodily expressions as gestalt structures can give a steadier ground to DP's accounts.",Sarah Songhorian,SNGSRH87A47F205O

It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, have appropriate training, do not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, have continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, motivation of medical students must be evaluated in order to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate motivation of medical students to be part of the health team to help in the COVID19 pandemic. Methods and Findings: We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students perceptions about participating in care of patients with suspected infection due to coronavirus during the COVID19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) individual characteristics, year and geographic location of medical school; b) twenty eight statements responded on a 5 point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings of a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyse the data. Statements with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in COVID19 pandemic were related to sense of purpose or duty (It is the duty of the medical student to put himself at the service of the population in the pandemic), altruism (I am willing to take risks by participating in practical in the context of pandemic), perception of good performance and professional identity (I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic). Males had higher odds ratios than females (1.36 [95% CI: 1.24 to 1.49] to 1.68 [95% CI: 1.47 to 1.91]). Conclusions: Medical students are motivated by sense of purpose or duty, altruism, perception of good performance and values of professionalism more than their interest in learning. These results have implications in the developing of programs of volunteering and in the design of health force policies in the present pandemic and in future health emergencies.",Sarah Songhorian,SNGSRH87A47F205O

By employing electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 21 participants undergoing the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), we propose a machine learning (ML)-driven methodology to decode the Big Five personality traits—Extraversion (Ex), Agreeableness (A), Neuroticism (N), Conscientiousness (C), and Openness (O)—using classification algorithms such as support vector machine (SVM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) applied to 64-electrode EEG sensor data. A novel multiphase neurocognitive analysis across the TSST stages (baseline, mental arithmetic, job interview, and recovery) systematically evaluates the bidirectional relationship between personality traits and stress-induced neural responses. The proposed framework reveals significant negative correlations between frontal–temporal theta–beta ratio (TBR) and self-reported Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and Openness, indicating faster stress recovery and higher cognitive resilience in individuals with elevated trait scores. The binary classification model achieves high accuracy (88.1% Ex, 94.7% A, 84.2% N, 81.5% C, and 93.4% O), surpassing the current benchmarks in personality neuroscience. These findings empirically validate the close alignment between personality constructs and neural oscillatory patterns, highlighting the potential of EEG-based sensing and machine-learning analytics for personalized mental-health monitoring and human-centric AI systems attuned to individual neurocognitive profiles.",Raffaele Gravina,GRVRFL82E07D086B

Wearable technologies have evolved into more sophisticated forms, significantly improving their capacity to capture the multimodal physiological signals from the individuals. The recorded physiological signals, including electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), photoplethysmography (PPG), and electromyography (EMG), contain significant and compelling information about the health conditions of individuals. This information has the potential to contribute to and enhance the longevity and subjective well-being, aspects that remain mostly unexplored to date. This review delves into the contemporary landscape of research, aiming to unravel the multifaceted interplay among personality traits, physiological signals, and biomarkers that collectively contribute to active and healthy aging. Specifically, we focus on sensing methods and techniques to identify particular personality traits and their connection with health outcomes. The review also outlines key studies that involve the physiological parameters used for health control and age related diseases.

Moreover, because of their bacterial ancestry, they can release potent immunogenic signals. In this study, we showed that the mitochondrial protease caseinolytic peptidase P (ClpP) is both a cell-intrinsic metabolic vulnerability and an actionable immunogenic trigger in multiple myeloma (MM). We found that ClpP messenger RNA is higher in bone marrow (BM)-purified malignant plasma cells than in normal or premalignant counterparts and that MM lines rank first in ClpP expression among human cancers. Moreover, we demonstrated that human MM cells are highly vulnerable to ClpP inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, MM cell dependence on ClpP was not accounted for by its acknowledged oxidative phosphorylation surveillance activity. Proteomic discovery of proteolytic targets, metabolomics, and metabolic tracing identified a critical control exerted by ClpP on ornithine aminotransferase abundance to sustain cytosolic biosynthesis of polyamines, which are essential for MM cells. Transcriptomics and targeted validation also revealed the activation of a cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)–dependent type I interferon (IFN) response in ClpP-silenced MM cells, whose supernatants boosted dendritic cell activation and ability to stimulate IFN-γ production by T cells. In vivo, ClpP silencing reshaped the BM immune environment in immunocompetent mice by significantly expanding IFN-γ–producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T memory cells, while containing exhausted CD4+ T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Thus, ClpP is a newly identified addiction of MM cells whose inhibition not only exerts cell-intrinsic toxicity but also triggers otherwise indolent antitumoral immunity. Our findings yield a novel immunogenic chemotherapeutic framework with potential relevance to myeloma.",Enrico Milan,MLNNRC85D30H620C

For each paper, we assessed the quality and completeness of technical characteristics with two ad hoc rating scales for motors and reducers; we extracted the main parameters of the actuation unit and a quantitative analysis of the mechanical characteristics of the individual components was carried out considering the exoskeleton application. Overall, we observed a lack of details in reporting on actuation systems equipped on exoskeletons. To overcome this limitation, herein we conclude by proposing a data form and a checklist to provide researchers with a common approach in reporting the mechanical characteristics of the actuation unit of their lower limb exoskeletons.

Despite significant progress, it's currently not known whether the unimodal-multimodal hierarchical organization undergoes recurrent changes itself - consistent with the existence of a dynamic repertoire of INT topographies. To this aim, we characterized the dynamics of topographic INT states by clustering the dynamic ACW-0 matrices in two different datasets: the source-reconstructed HCP resting-state MEG dataset, and a hd-EEG resting-state dataset, composed of healthy individuals and people with disorders of consciousness (DoCs). We found that healthy subjects display dynamic transitions between different INT states, which exhibit changing degrees of uni-transmodal cortical hierarchies. These dynamic transitions show non-random behavior, with moderate degrees of unpredictability and evidence of nontrivial memory effects. Unlike in healthy subjects, these properties are disrupted in DoC patients, who exhibit less predictable INT state transitions and less memory effects. Together, our results show a prominent role for the temporal richness of the transitions between different INT topographic states in the awake state which, as evidenced by our results, is key for maintaining an adequate level of consciousness.",Alessandra Del Felice,DLFLSN78P64Z133P

However, they are often not known a priori and need to be estimated from time series. In this study, we propose the use of permutation entropy (PE) to estimate time delays from neural time series as a more robust alternative to the widely used autocorrelation window (ACW). In the first part, we demonstrate the validity of this approach on synthetic neural data, and we show its resistance to regimes of nonstationarity in time series. Mirroring yet another example of comparable behavior between different nonlinear systems, permutation entropy–time delay estimation (PE-TD) is also able to measure intrinsic neural timescales (INTs) (temporal windows of neural activity at rest) from hd-EEG human data; additionally, this replication extends to the abnormal prolongation of INT values in disorders of consciousness (DoCs). Surprisingly, the correlation between ACW-0 and PE-TD decreases in a state-dependent manner when consciousness is lost, hinting at potential different regimes of nonstationarity and nonlinearity in conscious/unconscious states, consistent with many current theoretical frameworks on consciousness. In summary, we demonstrate the validity of PE-TD as a tool to extract relevant time scales from neural data; furthermore, given the divergence between ACW and PE-TD specific to DoC subjects, we hint at its potential use for the characterization of conscious states.",Alessandra Del Felice,DLFLSN78P64Z133P

Based on a person-centred and bio-psycho-social model, the study investigates the interactions among vulnerable users, caregivers, and the domestic environment. Its aim is to identify spatial and technological requirements essential for effectively supporting home care activities, while ensuring safety, comfort, usability, maintainability, and integration of assistive technologies. The research has led to the development of specific operational guidelines to support the design process for adapting the spaces most involved in caregiving activities. These guidelines propose alternative technical solutions, qualitatively assessed in terms of their building impact and compatibility with existing constraints. The developed guidelines will be integrated into a novel digital tool based on Building Information Modeling (BIM) methodologies, designed to facilitate multi-criteria simulation and evaluation of various design alternatives.

Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses examined the association of some oral frailty indicators with late-life cognitive and late-life depression (LLD). However, none of these studies investigated a large series of possible indicators and outcomes. Objective To clarify the impact of oral frailty indicators on late-life cognitive disorders and LLD. Design Systematic review. Subjects Sixty-three studies (56,520,662 subjects) with 11 oral frailty indicators in four categories: (i) oral health status deterioration, (ii) decline in oral motor skills, (iii) chewing, swallowing, and saliva disorders, and (iv) oral pain. Methods From database inception to April 24, 2024, six different electronic databases were consulted by two independent researchers assessing the eligibility of 24,045 records against the inclusion criteria and found 63 studies fitting the eligibility requirements. The protocol was registered a priori with PROSPERO (CRD42021249428). Results Four oral frailty indicators (number of remaining teeth, periodontal disease, difficulties in chewing, and difficulties in swallowing) were associated with late-life cognitive impairment/decline, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), dementia, and LLD. Among categories, oral health status deterioration and chewing, swallowing, and saliva disorders were associated with late-life cognitive impairment/decline, MCI, dementia, and LLD. Decline in oral motor skills was associated with late-life cognitive impairment/decline, while oral pain was related only to LLD. Conclusion Certain oral frailty indicators may contribute to the development of late-life cognitive disorders and LLD.",VITTORIO DIBELLO,DBLVTR77T16F376W

Methods Informal caregivers were recruited through key informants working in the third sector and social support organizations. Two focus groups were carried out and transcripts were coded and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results The sample included a total of 19 informal caregivers of people with dementia. Three themes emerged: (1) The impact of dementia on caregivers; (2) The relevance of dementia education for caregivers and society; and (3) Caregivers’ information and education needs. The general lack of information and education about dementia from the very first diagnosis affected the chance for caregivers to be effectively supported and prevent and de-escalate caregivers’ emotional distress.

In the philosophical literature, vulnerability is understood not only to be an ontological condition of humanity, but also to be a consequence of contingent factors. Within bioethics debates, vulnerable populations are defined in relation to compromised capacity to consent, increased susceptibility to harm, and/or exploitation. Although vulnerability has historically been associated with older adults, to date, no comprehensive or systematic work exists on the meaning of their vulnerability. To fill this gap, we analysed the literature on aged care for the meaning, foundations, and uses of vulnerability as an ethical concept. Methods Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of argument-based ethics literature in four major databases: PubMed, Embase®, Web of Science™, and Philosopher’s Index. These covered biomedical, philosophy, bioethical, and anthropological literature. Titles, abstracts, and full texts of identified papers were screened for relevance. The snowball technique and citation tracking were used to identify relevant publications. Data analysis and synthesis followed the preparatory steps of the coding process detailed in the QUAGOL methodology. Results Thirty-eight publications met our criteria and were included. Publication dates ranged from 1984 to 2020, with 17 publications appearing between 2015 and 2020. Publications originated from all five major continents, as indicated by the affiliation of the first author. Our analyses revealed that the concept of vulnerability could be distinguished in terms of basic human and situational vulnerability. Six dimensions of older adults’ vulnerability were identified: physical; psychological; relational/interpersonal; moral; sociocultural, political, and economic; and existential/spiritual. This analysis suggested three ways to relate to older adults’ vulnerability: understanding older adults’ vulnerability, taking care of vulnerable older adults, and intervening through socio-political-economic measures. Conclusions The way in which vulnerability was conceptualised in the included publications overlaps with distinctions used within contemporary bioethics literature. Dimensions of aged care vulnerability map onto defining features of humans, giving weight to the claim that vulnerability represents an inherent characteristic of humans. Vulnerability is mostly a value-laden concept, endowed with positive and negative connotations. Most publications focused on and promoted aged care, strengthening the idea that care is a defining practice of being human.",Roberta Sala,SLARRT64L44C139A

Frailty can be prevented, reversed or mitigated by early screening for frailty risk in community-dwelling older adults, allowing for preventive interventions on clinical and social determinants. Objectives The present article reports the preliminary results of the SUNFRAIL+ study multidimensional cascade assessment in a group of community-dwelling older adults of 8 Italian regions aimed to stratify the population according to the needs of care at the first administration, integrated with the quality of life (QoL) assessment to evaluate the impact of early, integrated care. Methods The SUNFRAIL+ study performed a multidimensional assessment of community-dwelling older adults by linking elements of the SUNFRAIL frailty assessment tool with an in-depth assessment of biopsychosocial domains of frailty, through validated questionnaires and physical tests. Results The sample consisted of 743 participants (279 males and 464 females). The mean score of the multidimensional assessment with the SUNFRAIL tool was 2.31 (SD ± 0.7) with the cut-off point of frailty set at 3. The analysis revealed a significant difference in SUNFRAIL scores between the age groups. The results confirmed that individuals with higher frailty scores are significantly more likely to experience falls. Significant and conceptually valid correlations were found between physical and cognitive tests and QoL scores. Frailty is significantly associated with a lower physical and mental quality of life. The results indicated that older age and lower education levels are associated with higher frailty scores. Conclusion The study demonstrates important different correlation levels, firstly between the assessment of frailty by SUNFRAIL and the perceived QoL; secondarily among all SUNFRAIL spheres and their second test sets that more objectively evaluate each frailty domain. The study demonstrates that the SUNFRAIL+ approach accurately assesses frailty status owing to its strong correlation with the SF-12 quality of life assessment.",Guido Iaccarino,CCRGDU67C05F839G

This study administered a Matching Pairs (MP) game to a group of healthy volunteers while acquiring eye-tracking data, specifically pupil dilation and blinking behavior. A dedicated algorithm has been implemented for game score assessment. A set of linear and nonlinear features were extracted from physiological signals. Statistical analysis was performed to understand whether oculometric parameters differ between the best and worst MP game trials. Moreover, correlation analysis investigated possible relationships between physiological measures and players’ performance. Results showed statistically significant smaller pupil dilation velocity, higher Index of Pupillary Activity (IPA), and shorter blink rate in the best MP trial than in the worst one. Our outcomes could highlight better cognitive resource management and greater focus in the best trial. Moreover, participants’ scores were negatively correlated with blinking rate and the time the eyes were closed during the game. It showed that more focus on specific game tasks leads to better performance, therefore limiting interruptions of the information flow due to blinking. These findings may suggest that eye parameters in serious gaming platforms could be a powerful tool for intervention programs targeting older populations or people with cognitive impairments.",Pietro Tarchi,TRCPTR93H07D612I

Alongside behavioural measures, it is important to investigate and understand the neural mechanisms underlying unconscious beliefs, and opinions and how external factors can influence them. Therefore, this study administered a Single-Category Implicit Association Test to 22 healthy volunteers while acquiring EEG signals. After an automatic preprocessing pipeline was applied, 1000ms-long epochs were extracted from cleaned EEG data for target words only. Latencies and amplitudes were computed in specific brain regions and time intervals for the P1, N1, P2 (both occipital and frontal), P3, and N4 (both frontal and frontocentral) event-related potentials (ERPs). Statistical analysis has highlighted that incongruent associations elicited significantly shorter N1 latencies, which may be due to stimuli familiarisation, longer P3 latencies, which can be related to the allocation of more attentional resources, and larger N4 amplitudes, which suggest greater cognitive efforts. Correlation analysis has also found a significant relationship between the amplitude of the N4 and explicit behaviour. These results suggest that ERPs can highlight different mental processes involved in violating social expectations towards climate change and that their features may be used to support behavioural measures in assessing implicit attitudes more reliably.",Pietro Tarchi,TRCPTR93H07D612I

In this context, pupillometry represents a non-invasive, cost-effective methodology to analyse the activity of the autonomic nervous system and indirectly measure arousal and cognitive load. This study proposes the investigation of pupillometry signal dynamics acquired from a group of healthy subjects during a matching pairs card game session. Lyapunov's theory has been applied to evaluate the nonlinear content of pupillometry dynamic. The emotional states of involved subjects have been assessed through the PANAS scale. Statistical analysis showed that game playing significantly increased positive emotions and, concurrently, decreased negative ones. Spearman correlation analyses showed a significant relationship between arousal and Large Lyapunov Exponent, negative emotions and standard deviation of pupil diameter. Moreover, the latency of the maximum pupil dilation significantly differed in players with high-performance scores compared to low-performance subjects.

Despite efforts to enrich infant and toddler formulas with functional ingredients, significant biochemical differences persist. This study aimed to characterize and compare the metabolomic composition of human milk, cow’s milk (both conventional and lactose-free), goat’s milk, and a variety of commercial formulas, including both infant (0–12 months) and toddler (1–3 years) formulations, using 1H NMR-based metabolomics. Methods: A total of 90 milk samples were analyzed, including eight formula milk brands, four human milk samples, four goat milk brands, and seven cow milk products. 1H NMR spectra were acquired and processed to identify 54 metabolites. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were used to assess compositional similarities and differences among milk types. Results: Human milk displayed a unique metabolic signature, enriched in fucosylated oligosaccharides (2′-FL, 3′-FL), N-acetylated carbohydrates, and amino acids such as glutamine and glutamate. Goat milk was characterized by higher levels of creatine, carnitine, and succinate, whereas cow milk showed elevated orotate, butyrate, and mannose. Formulations exhibited a relatively homogeneous composition across brands but differed from human and animal milk, particularly in choline, formate, and added micronutrients. Toddler formulas contained more energy-related compounds (e.g., creatine, maltose) compared to infant formulas. Conclusions: While modern formulas provide nutritional adequacy, they remain metabolically distinct from human milk.

Given Italy’s demographic scenario, it is important to design age-friendly policies on the national and local levels. The paper contributes to the research of this topic through a technique for analysing citywide assessment data on age-friendliness. Our study presents the process of validation for the Italian older population of a standardised tool: the Age-Friendly Cities and Communities Questionnaire. The study was conducted in three Italian cities ( n = 1,213) on a representative sample of older people who were asked to rate their life in the city, following the dimensions considered essential for a community’s age-friendliness by the World Health Organization. Four typologies were differentiated in the analysis, resulting in different views of older adults on their experience of living in the city, showing that people’s socioeconomic status and their health situation play a role in shaping their perceptions of age-friendliness. The results highlight the importance of standardised tools for effective social policies for age-friendly cities.",Michele Bertani,BRTMHL68H17L781J

New therapeutic strategies are required to target cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subset of tumor cells highly resistant to present-day therapy and responsible for tumor relapse. CSCs display dynamic genetic and epigenetic alterations that allow quick adaptations to perturbations. Lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (KDM1A also known as LSD1), a FAD-dependent H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2 demethylase, was found to be upregulated in several tumors and associated with a poor prognosis due to its ability to maintain CSCs staminal features. Here, we explored the potential role of KDM1A targeting in CRC by characterizing the effect of KDM1A silencing in differentiated and CRC stem cells (CRC-SCs). In CRC samples, KDM1A overexpression was associated with a worse prognosis, confirming its role as an independent negative prognostic factor of CRC. Consistently, biological assays such as methylcellulose colony formation, invasion, and migration assays demonstrated a significantly decreased self-renewal potential, as well as migration and invasion potential upon KDM1A silencing. Our untargeted multi-omics approach (transcriptomic and proteomic) revealed the association of KDM1A silencing with CRC-SCs cytoskeletal and metabolism remodeling towards a differentiated phenotype, supporting the role of KDM1A in CRC cells stemness maintenance. Also, KDM1A silencing resulted in up-regulation of miR-506-3p, previously reported to play a tumor-suppressive role in CRC. Lastly, loss of KDM1A markedly reduced 53BP1 DNA repair foci, implying the involvement of KDM1A in the DNA damage response. Overall, our results indicate that KDM1A impacts CRC progression in several non-overlapping ways, and therefore it represents a promising epigenetic target to prevent tumor relapse.",Daniela Capello,CPLDNL70S54L219J

Therefore, we performed a comparison study between EVs isolated by ultracentrifugation and by affinity substrate separation from plasma EDTA and sodium citrate. The EVs were characterized by Nano Tracking Analysis, Western Blot, cytofluorimetric analysis of surface markers, and lipidomic analysis. While anticoagulants did not significantly alter any of the analyzed parameters, the isolation methods influenced EVs size, purity, surface markers expression and lipidomic profile. Compared to ultracentrifugation, affinity substrate separation yielded bigger particles highly enriched in tetraspanins (CD9, CD63, CD81), fatty acids and glycerolipids, with a predominant LDL- and vLDL-like contamination.

Understanding public attitudes, fears, and concerns toward biobanking is fundamental to designing targeted interventions to increase trust towards biobanks. The aim of our study was to investigate the level of knowledge and perception of biobanks in students and personnel of the University of Piemonte Orientale. An online questionnaire was designed and administered via e-mail. A total of 17,758 UPO personnel and students were invited to participate in the survey, and 1521 (9.3%) subjects completed the survey. The results showed that 65.0% of the participants were aware of the term “biobank” and knew what the activity of a biobank was, and 76.3% of subjects were willing to provide biospecimens to a research biobank, whereas 67.3% of the respondents were willing to contribute, in addition to biospecimens, their health and lifestyle data.

Drug repurposing is attracting increasing attention because, compared to traditional de novo drug discovery processes, it may reduce drug development periods and costs. Epidemiological and preclinical evidence support the antitumor activity of antipsychotic drugs. Herein, we dissect the mechanism of action of the typical antipsychotic spiperone in CRC. Spiperone can reduce the clonogenic potential of stem-like CRC cells (CRC-SCs) and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, in both differentiated and CRC-SCs, at clinically relevant concentrations whose toxicity is negligible for non-neoplastic cells. Analysis of intracellular Ca2+ kinetics upon spiperone treatment revealed a massive phospholipase C (PLC)-dependent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ release, resulting in ER Ca2+ homeostasis disruption. RNA sequencing revealed unfolded protein response (UPR) activation, ER stress, and induction of apoptosis, along with IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) activation. Lipidomic analysis showed a significant alteration of lipid profile and, in particular, of sphingolipids. Damage to the Golgi apparatus was also observed. Our data suggest that spiperone can represent an effective drug in the treatment of CRC, and that ER stress induction, along with lipid metabolism alteration, represents effective druggable pathways in CRC.",Daniela Capello,CPLDNL70S54L219J

Methods: Older adults and their caregivers were recruited from the geriatric outpatient memory clinic of an Italian hospital. Caregiver stress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12 items (GHQ-12). HL was measured using the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) and the Short Form of the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults (S-TOFHLA). Results: A total of 170 (71% females) caregivers, including spouses and offspring, were included in the analysis. According to the NVS, 53% demonstrated adequate HL, while 83% achieved adequate scores on the S-TOFHLA. The median GHQ-12 score was 15, with 48% presenting a score above 14, indicating higher stress levels; women reported significantly higher GHQ-12 scores than men. In a multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, education, and number of care tasks provided, the S-TOFHLA score showed a borderline association with the GHQ-12 score (B = −1.45; p = 0.064). When characteristics of the care-recipient were added to the model, the S-TOFHLA score emerged as an independent predictor of the GHQ-12 score (B = −1.41; p = 0.048), along with female caregiver sex and behavioral and psychological symptoms in the care-recipients. Exploratory analysis suggested that the association between HL and stress was present among male but not female caregivers. Conclusions: HL was associated with psychological stress in caregivers of older adults with dementia, with the relationship appearing more pronounced among male caregivers.",Guglielmo Bonaccorsi,BNCGLL65S17A561E

Despite the evidence being in favor of the application of teamwork, its adoption in primary care (PC) systems remains difficult. In Italy, a recent national policy supports the strengthening of IP teamwork in the “House of Community”—HoC (a model of Community Health Centers), but its implementation needs further evaluation. This study examines how IP teamwork has developed within a HoC in an Italian neighborhood, focusing on its transition toward a more structured collaborative practice and examining the perceptions and experiences of PC professionals. Methods: Nine semi-structured interviews and 2 focus-groups were conducted with PC professionals from different PC services. Then, an analytical model was proposed. Data were analyzed using both deductive and inductive approaches. Results: Four main themes emerged: rethinking of traditional roles and scopes of practices, leadership/management skills and time/space, IP initiatives, and early perceptions. Based on these findings, an analytical model of teamwork evolution identified 3 interconnected key areas: resource, process, and context. Conclusion: The integration of an IP teamwork into the broader healthcare structure can enhance the promotion of a cohesive and collaborative organization, while also recognizing and dealing with its challenges.",Guglielmo Bonaccorsi,BNCGLL65S17A561E

However, the effectiveness of shared reading among older adults requires further evidence. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the impact and effectiveness of shared reading groups in slowing cognitive impairment, improving social interaction, promoting psychosocial well-being, and enhancing functional aspects among older adults living in the community. The selection criteria included studies published in English after 2000 focusing on individuals aged 60 and above and examining the benefits of shared reading. The studies also included participants with cognitive or psychiatric conditions who were independent. Seven databases were queried for this research. A total of 11 articles met the inclusion criteria. A descriptive analysis of the included studies revealed the tools used to measure the impact of interventions on outcomes and the key results obtained. Despite variability in methodology and outcomes, the results showed that group activities can improve self-rated health and reduce depressive symptoms in older adults. Interventions that include reading as a form of cognitive stimulation enhance communication skills, contribute to well-being, improve quality of life, reduce loneliness, and increase social engagement. Shared reading has positive effects on satisfaction with social relationships and community support. The findings suggested that shared reading groups represent a promising, non-pharmacological intervention for promoting psychological health, well-being, and social interaction.

The study aims to identify the communication strategies that have been evaluated in promoting awareness and/or climate friendly behaviors in older adults. Methods We searched multiple electronic databases for studies that evaluated the effects of any interventions aimed at communicating climate change to older persons (over 65 years) and assessed the results as awareness and /or behavioral changes. We selected quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies, and we also included systematic reviews for cross-referencing. Risk of bias of included studies was evaluated using different tools according to the study design. Results From a total of 5,486 articles, only 3 studies were included. One mixed-method study engaged older adults to assess the community vulnerability to climate change and to develop adaptation recommendations based on their perspectives; one qualitative study conducted focus groups to identify the more effective language, values and themes based on participants’ responses to narratives; one quantitative study utilized a 360-degree audio-visual platform allowing users to engage with immersive visualizations of sea-level rise scenarios. Discussion Despite the paucity of literature, this review demonstrates the potential for different strategies to increase the awareness of older persons about climate change.

However, the use of circulating GDF15 (c-GDF15) as a biomarker of sarcopenia is still debated. Moreover, the role of GDF15 intracellular precursor, pro-GDF15, in human skeletal muscle (SM-GDF15) is not totally understood. In order to clarify these points, the association of both forms of GDF15 with parameters of muscle strength, body composition, metabolism and inflammation was investigated. Methods the levels of c-GDF15 and SM-GDF15 were evaluated in plasma and muscle biopsies, respectively, of healthy subjects (HS) and patients with lower limb mobility impairment (LLMI), either young (&lt;40 years-old) or old (&gt;70 years-old). Other parameters included in the analysis were Isometric Quadriceps Strength (IQS), BMI, lean and fat mass percentage, Vastus lateralis thickness, as well as circulating levels of Adiponectin, Leptin, Resistin, IGF-1, Insulin, IL6, IL15 and c-PLIN2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) and Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis were performed. Results c-GDF15 but not SM-GDF15 levels resulted associated with decreased IQS and IGF-1 levels in both HS and LLMI, while only in LLMI associated with increased levels of Resistin. Moreover, in LLMI both c-GDF15 and SM-GDF15 levels were associated with IL-6 levels, but interestingly SM-GDF15 is lower in LLMI with respect to HS. Furthermore, a discrimination of the four groups of subjects based on these parameters was possible with PCA and CDA. In particular HS, LLMI over 70 years or under 40 years of age were discriminated based on SM-GDF15, c-GDF15 and Insulin levels, respectively. Conclusion our data support the idea that c-GDF15 level could be used as a biomarker of decreased muscle mass and strength. Moreover, it is suggested that c-GDF15 has a different diagnostic significance with respect to SM-GDF15, which is likely linked to a healthy and active state.",MARIA CONTE,CNTMRA81M61F152H

Gerontechnology, a field of research that combines the knowledge of gerontology with technological advances, is central to supporting ageing because it aims to improve prevention and care. Scientific literature and the latest data suggest that, in Italy, the difference in access to and use of technologies between the older and young populations is quite marked. In order to ensure that these technologies are acceptable, accessible and inclusive, it is crucial to know and consider the barriers (cognitive, physical and sensory limitations) that hinder their use by the older population. This paper explores how the Human-Centred Design approach, in particular the questionnaire, focus group, design workshop, and systematic literature review, facilitated the identification of such limitations and needs of the older population, using this information to develop design strategies for innovative and accessible gerontechnologies. Considering also Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda, the challenge for the coming years is to design inclusive and win–win technologies to promote active and healthy ageing.",Mattia Pistolesi,PSTMTT86T10G843B

The device was characterized in the range of 15–30 breaths per minute (bpm), to simulate moderate difficult breathing, borderline normal breathing, and normal spontaneous breathing. These three breathing typologies were artificially reproduced by setting the expiratory to inspiratory ratios (E:I) at 1:1, 2:1, 3:1. The prototype was able to accurately recognize the breath states with a low response time (~35 ms), excellent linearity (R2 = 0.997) and low hysteresis. The piezoelectric device was also characterized by placing it in an activated carbon filter mask to evaluate the pressure generated by exhaled air through breathing acts. The results indicate suitability also for the monitoring of very weak breath, exhibiting good linearity, accuracy, and reproducibility, in very low breath pressures, ranging from 0.09 to 0.16 kPa. These preliminary results are very promising for the future development of smart wearable devices able to monitor different patients breathing patterns, also related to breathing diseases, providing a suitable real-time diagnosis in a non-invasive and fast way.",Luca  Francioso,FRNLNN76E30Z133J

However, a significant proportion of patients show resistance to immunotherapy, and predictive biomarkers for non-responders or high-risk recurring patients are currently lacking. Recent studies have shown that tumor-related metabolic fingerprints can be useful in predicting prognosis and response to therapy in various cancer types. Our study aimed to identify serum-derived metabolomic signatures that could predict clinical responses in MM patients treated with ICIs. Patients and methods 1 H-NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) was used to analyze the serum metabolomic profiles from 71 MM patients undergoing anti-PD-1 therapy (43 patients as first-line, 27 as second-line, 1 as third-line). Feature selection was applied to identify key metabolites within these profiles, to develop risk score models predicting overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Results A multivariable model was used to identify distinct prognostic factors for OS. Negative factors included glucose, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B-very low-density lipoprotein (ApoB-VLDL), whereas glutamine and free HDL cholesterol emerged as positive factors. They were then used to construct a risk score model able to stratify patients in prognostic groups. Similarly, a separate predictive risk score model for PFS was developed, focusing solely on glucose and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) HDL. Threefold cross validation resulted in mean concordance indices of 0.72 and 0.74 for PFS and OS, respectively. Importantly, this analysis was replicated in patients who received first-line ICIs. Interestingly, the prognostic score for OS included glutamine, glucose, and LDL (low-density lipoprotein) triglycerides, whereas only glucose negatively influenced PFS. In this subset, the concordance indices increased to 0.81 and 0.9 for PFS and OS, respectively. Conclusions Our data identified glycolipid signatures as robust predictors of distinct therapeutic outcomes in MM patients treated with ICIs. These results could pave the way for novel therapeutic approaches.",Leonardo Tenori,TNRLRD77E24G999C

Further, reproducibility and meta-analyses are extremely challenging, owing to the limited rationale on dosage and experimental standardization. It is specifically to address the fundamental question on the anti-inflammatory effects of electricity on biological systems, that we propose a series of controlled experiments on the effects of direct and alternate current delivered on a standardized 3D bioconstruct constituted by fibroblasts and keratinocytes in a collagen matrix, in the presence or absence of TNF-α as conventional inflammation inducer.

The healthcare sector is one of the sectors most affected by this digital revolution.Gerontechnology, a relatively recent field of research, studies the interaction between increasing longevity combined with a decreasing birth rate and the development of emerging healthcare technologies (Bouma et al., 2007; Chen, 2020).Therefore, from a theoretical point of view, digital health technologies (wearable devices, social media, robotics, smart devices, virtual technologies, etc.) can support successful ageing (van Bronswijk et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2020), but in practice, the results achieved do not live up to the expectations of elderly users, as the elderly population is less able to access new technologies as they are less open to innovation (Loges & Jung; 2001; van Dijk & Hacker, 2003; Manchester & Jarke, 2022).The EU's 2022 report (European Commission, 2022) on the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) places Italy 18th among the 27 EU Member States, which can be attributed to the relative lack of literacy of the Italian elderly population, although, compared to 2021, Italy gained two points (20th place). In order to limit the Grey Digital Divide, gerontechnology design in recent years has been influenced by the anthropocentric approach, a design approach that places the elderly within the design process (Baker et al., 2019; Vines et al., 2015; Wallace et al., 2020) considering them as a social resource and not as frail, sick and dependent. Design, and in particular the Human-Centred Design approach, can play a crucial role both in understanding the needs of the elderly population and in translating these needs into digital products that are more suitable and relevant to their purpose. For these reasons, in this article we introduce the first results of the research carried out by the Ergonomics and Design Lab.

Results The dataset was split into training and test sets, based on a 70:30 ratio and matching on age, sex, and proportion of events; 3,520 models were set out to train. The three predictive algorithms (optimized for performance, interpretability, or aggressive feature selection) converged on the same model, including 12 variables: pre-COVID-19 mobility, World Health Organization disease severity, age, heart rate, arterial blood gases bicarbonate and oxygen saturation, serum potassium, systolic blood pressure, blood glucose, aspartate aminotransferase, PaO2/FiO2 ratio and derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Conclusion Beyond variables reflecting the severity of COVID-19 disease failure, pre-morbid mobility level was the strongest factor associated with in-hospital mortality reflecting the importance of functional status as a synthetic measure of health in older adults, while the association between derived neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and mortality, confirms the fundamental role played by neutrophils in SARS-CoV-2 disease.",Giuseppina Dell'Aquila,DLLGPP77S56C726I

Nevertheless, its prevalence is still underestimated and there is still debate about the appropriateness and efficacy of artificial nutrition in subjects with severe dysphagia. The objective assesses the prevalence of dysphagia in European and Israeli NHRs, its association with mortality, and the relationship of different nutritional interventions, i.e. texture modified diets and artificial nutrition (AN) - with weight loss and mortality. Methods A prospective observational study three thousand fifty one European and Israeli NHRs older than 65 years, participating in the SHELTER study from 2009 to 2011, at baseline and after 12 months. All residents underwent a standardized comprehensive evaluation using the interRAI Long Term Care Facility (LTCF). Cognitive status was assessed using the Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS), functional status using Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Hierarchy scale. Trained staff assessed dysphagia at baseline by clinical observation. Data on weight loss were collected for all participants at baseline and after 12 months. Deaths were registered by nursing home staff. Results The prevalence of dysphagia was 30,3%. During the one-year follow-up, the mortality rate in subjects with dysphagia was significantly higher compared with that of non-dysphagic subjects (31.3% vs 17.0% (p = 0,001). The multivariate analysis showed that NHRs with dysphagia had 58% higher risk of death within 1 year compared with non-dysphagic subjects (OR 1.58, 95% CI, 1.31–1.91). The majority of NHRs with dysphagia were prescribed texture modified diets (90,6%), while AN was used in less than 10% of subjects. No statistically significant difference was found concerning weight loss and mortality after 12 months following the two different nutritional treatments. Conclusions Dysphagia is prevalent among NHRs and it is associated with increased mortality, independent of the nutritional intervention used. Noticeably, after 12 months of nutritional intervention, NHRs treated with artificial nutrition had similar mortality and weight loss compared to those who were treated with texture modified diets, despite the clinical conditions of patients on artificial nutrition were more compromised.",Giuseppina Dell'Aquila,DLLGPP77S56C726I

Over the past three decades, TTV has garnered increasing attention due to its ability to establish lifelong chronic viremia, which intriguingly fluctuates among individuals in relation to immune competence status, with a typical peak after an organ transplantation, followed by a plateau and a slow decrease. The regulatory mechanisms underlying TTV infection remain elusive, and factors influencing its interactions with the immune system have yet to be identified. To explore this complex interplay, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns associated with TTV load in older adult hospitalized patients (mean age: 83.15 ± 7.49) from the PROMOTERA cohort. In this study, we present for the first time the identification of differentially methylated probes (DMPs) correlated to TTV load in our cohort. The statistically significant DMPs were located in genes involved in immune regulation and lipid metabolism. To further characterize these findings, we performed an exploratory enrichment analysis by applying several p -value thresholds, which yielded multiple gene lists derived from the sets of significant probes. Genes associated with this epigenetic signature were found to enrich functional pathways related to immune activation, leukocyte differentiation, and cytokine production, while additional significantly enriched gene sets were involved in cell–cell adhesion and cell migration processes. Since our analysis followed an exploratory approach, these results should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating and warrant further investigation.

Concerns about the negative impact of significant population decline on Europe’s future economic development and social cohesion are increasingly featured in official documents and public debates. Recent studies agree that the current population decline in developed countries is a systemic process, path-dependent, self-sustaining and geographically heterogeneous, with a strong degree of inertia. This paper introduces a meaningful and straightforward index – the Systemic Depopulation Areas Index (SyDAs) – easily replicable and updatable, designed to identify the presence or absence of a systemic depopulation process at the local level, using time series analysis. The new index was tested over the period 2002-2021 on the municipalities of a region in southern Italy: Molise. This index could be a useful tool for evaluating the effectiveness of future policies, such as the SNAI (National Strategy for “Inner Areas”) and the Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), (Next Generation EU) by capturing reversal in depopulation processes at the local level. The results reveal a potential mismatch at local level between the geographical areas targeted by policy interventions and those most in need of intervention to halt population decline.",Cecilia Tomassini,TMSCCL68E62H501P

Although regional and urban‐rural differences in relations between older parents and their children have been studied, the impact of municipal remoteness in terms of distance from essential services and accessibility remains largely unknown. Using official ISTAT classification of municipality remoteness and data from four waves of the Italian survey “Famiglie e Soggetti Sociali” (1998, 2003, 2009, 2016), we investigated the association between proximity and face‐to‐face contact with the remoteness of the municipalities in which older parents reside. Our results shed new light on the geographical impact on intergenerational ties and support networks, showing that co‐residence is less common in remote areas. Furthermore, older parents residing in remote areas appear to have less frequent contact with their children. This persistent geographical divide, coupled with population ageing, risks exacerbating the vulnerability of older parents in remote areas, given their limited access to formal care infrastructures. These results underscore the need for policymakers to design new strategies that adequately address the future challenges of population ageing.",Cecilia Tomassini,TMSCCL68E62H501P

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), a known marker of systemic inflammation, has been investigated in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) though its prognostic value in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) progression to dementia remains controversial. This study aims at evaluating the NLR as a potential prognostic biomarker for progression to dementia in a sample of individuals with MCI. Methods The study sample included 91 individuals with MCI of amnestic type. Socio-demographic, clinical, functional, neuropsychological and laboratory data of participants were collected. The NLR parameter was assessed at the baseline visit. Participants were followed up to five years and censored at the time of the onset of dementia or at drop out from the study (for any reason). The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the Youden Index were applied to determine the best discriminant NLR cutoff value. Based on this value, participants were divided in two groups and rates of dementia were estimated. Cox regression models were used to estimate the predictive effect of NLR on the risk of conversion to dementia. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% Confindence Intervals (CI) were estimated from these models. Results Overall, 40 participants converted to dementia with an incidence rate of conversion of 18.7 cases per 100 person-years. The optimal threshold of NLR to predict conversion to dementia resulted 2.25, with a sensitivity of 74.4% and a specificity of 65.3% (Youden index = 0.40, Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.74). After adjusting for relevant confounders, a NLR higher than 2.25 was associated with an increased risk of developing dementia over three years (adj. HR = 3.58, 95% CI : 1.61–7.97; p = 0.002). Using the literature-based NLR threshold of 2.5 confirmed the association, showing a similarly increased risk of dementia (adj. HR = 2.80, 95% CI: 1.33–5.92, p = 0.007). Conclusions This study suggests that NLR, despite its limited specificity, may be a useful indicator for identifying individuals with MCI at increased risk of dementia. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and explore its clinical applicability. Clinical trial number : not applicable",Antonio   Cherubini,CHRNTN66L09I921H

Homozygous mutations in TENT5A cause a rare form of osteogenesis imperfecta due to impaired collagen deposition by osteoblasts. TENT5C is frequently mutated or deleted in patients with multiple myeloma, the cancer of antibody‐secreting plasma cells, and TENT5D alterations result in male infertility. TENT5 members are noncanonical poly(A)polymerases that selectively stabilize mRNAs encoding endoplasmic reticulum–imported proteins, thus promoting the expression of secretory cargoes and proteins involved in folding, glycosylation, and trafficking along the secretory apparatus. This specificity has been proposed to be linked to TENT5 localization at the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, thanks to their interaction with transmembrane FNDC3 proteins. Recently, key roles of TENT5 proteins have been described in cancer, bone homeostasis, immunity, stemness, and fertility. This review will comprehensively analyze the identified cellular functions of this novel family of secretory tuners in physiological and pathological conditions, highlighting the proposed molecular mechanisms and the remaining open questions.",Enrico Milan,MLNNRC85D30H620C

The Golgi complex is fundamental for the processing and sorting of proteins and lipids in the secretory pathway. It is organized as stacks of cisternae laterally connected by tubules to form a continuous Golgi ribbon. During G2, the Golgi ribbon is unlinked into isolated stacks in preparation for cell division. This structural reorganization is necessary for entry into mitosis, indicating that a “Golgi mitotic checkpoint” controls the correct segregation of this organelle. To understand the physiological significance of the pre-mitotic Golgi unlinking, we devised a strategy to accumulate cells in G2 with an intact Golgi ribbon and then induce entry into mitosis. Here, we show that forcing the entry of cells into mitosis with an intact Golgi ribbon causes remarkable cell division defects, including spindle multipolarity and binucleation, favoring cell transformation. We also find that the cells entering mitosis with an intact Golgi ribbon show reduced levels at the centrosome of the kinase Aurora-A, a pivotal regulator of spindle formation. Overexpression of Aurora-A rescues spindle formation, indicating that the Golgi-dependent Aurora-A recruitment has a crucial role in spindle formation. Thus, our results show that alterations of the pre-mitotic Golgi segregation have profound consequences on the fidelity of the mitotic process, representing potential risk factors for cell transformation and cancer development.",FABIOLA MASCANZONI,MSCFBL87T62F839A

This demographic shift places increasing pressure on families and the welfare system, particularly given limited public expenditure on long-term care (LTC) and the strong reliance on informal caregiving. Within Italy’s familistic welfare model, informal care – primarily provided by migrant workers and family members – remains a cornerstone of support for older adults. This paper examines how socioeconomic status (SES) and gender intersect to shape the provision of informal caregiving. Drawing on data from the 2019 Italian module of the European Health Interview Survey (EHIS), we analyze caregiving patterns among adults aged 50 and over. SES is operationalized through educational attainment and income, which serve as proxies for individual and family resources. Our findings reveal a positive association between SES and the likelihood of providing low-intensity caregiving (&lt; 10 hours per week). However, this gradient weakens at higher levels of intensity (10–20 or &gt; 20 hours per week), suggesting a threshold beyond which SES differences become less pronounced. Gender disparities are also evident: while women are more likely to provide care across SES groups, men with higher SES are disproportionately represented in low-intensity caregiving. This pattern may reflect evolving norms and progressive attitudes among highly educated men, challenging traditional gender roles. Overall, the study underscores the importance of both public and private support systems in mitigating the physical, mental, and social strains of caregiving. As demographic and societal changes continue to reshape family structures, understanding the interplay of SES, gender, and caregiving is essential for designing equitable and sustainable care arrangements in aging societies.",FRANCESCA ZANASI,ZNSFNC90P53F257N

Background Family diversity at older ages is growing in wealthy countries, with late union dissolutions increasingly occurring through separation and divorce rather than widowhood. Nonetheless, the correlates of silver splits in Europe, particularly regarding health within couples, remain underexplored. Method We utilized data from the European Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement (SHARE), spanning Waves 1 (2004–2005) to 9 (2021–2022), and employed discrete‐time event‐history analysis to model the risk of silver splits, separately among couples aged 50–64 and 65+ ( N = 31,915 and 48,361 couple‐years, respectively). We inspected three health dimensions: self‐rated health, Global Activity Limitations Index, depression. Results We found a non‐negligible and gendered association between health and union dissolution among couples aged 50–64. Couples in which the woman reported poor self‐rated health or faced severe activity limitations, whereas the man maintained good health, exhibited a higher risk of silver splits compared to couples in good health. Conversely, the risk of silver splits did not change significantly when the man experienced poor self‐rated health or activity limitations compared to couples in good health. Results among older couples suggested that the health/silver split link weakens with age. Conclusion Gendered health‐related selection effects appear among older European couples, as men struggle more than women with a partner's declining health, potentially jeopardizing the couple's stability.",Cecilia Tomassini,TMSCCL68E62H501P

Public health care spending is notably lower in southern Italy. As a result, health related migration is a major phenomenon, with many individuals traveling to other regions - especially from the south to the centre-north - to receive better medical care, particularly for serious illnesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, health migration declined significantly, underscoring the crucial role of local and regional health care systems in responding to external shocks. This study examines health care accessibility for older people at municipality level in three regions: Lombardy (northern Italy), Tuscany (central Italy), and Molise (southern Italy). It assesses inequalities in health care supply and demand and evaluates regional health care system responses using the Enhanced Two-Step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) method. Health care accessibility varies considerably across these regions. While Lombardy and Tuscany generally offer high accessibility, Molise faces significant challenges. A substantial proportion of older residents in rural areas of Molise have no access to health care facilities within a 30-minute travel time. This disparity may contribute to inequalities in local health care access, potentially leading to severe consequences for the health and well-being of the older population.",Cecilia Tomassini,TMSCCL68E62H501P

The independent variables are related to socio-economic profiles of each municipality. The results, contextualised using a broad overview of the Italian case, show that a key variable in the demographic dynamics of the municipalities of Molise is the labour market activity rate of women and that this variable drives a spatial instability that cannot be detected using global approaches and models. This proves the urgent need to expand the use of local thinking for the benefit of both applied demography and society.",Cecilia Tomassini,TMSCCL68E62H501P

The advent of CDK4/6 inhibitors, namely, palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib, has changed the management of oestrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast tumours. The clinical success of these drugs for the treatment of breast cancer has encouraged diverse clinical trials aimed at exploring novel combinatorial regimens of CDK4/6 inhibitors in different types of tumours. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of these agents is essential to extend their benefits. Emerging evidence suggests that CDK4/6 inhibitors exert antitumour activity through other mechanisms beyond the acknowledged ability to block the cell cycle, including the induction of stress response pathways, the reprogramming of cancer cell metabolism, the modulation of the tumour microenvironment, the enhancement of the antitumour immune responses and the reduction of immune evasion. Nonetheless, the acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors remains a major therapeutic challenge. Thus, the identification of molecular drivers involved in the resistance to these drugs is crucial for the design of novel therapeutic approaches and the selection of patient-centred strategies in various types of tumours.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R

At steady state, the tenuous balance favors cancer growth. Therapies aimed at enhancing the immunogenic properties of cancer cells or the reacting immune responses can, however, revert the equilibrium to clear the host of cancer. The understanding of factors that affect this balance is progressing rapidly due to advances in high throughput technologies disclosing from previously uncharted territories new biologies referred to as ""dark matter"". These advances are critical for the understanding of the true mechanisms leading to immune-mediated cancer rejection.This review focuses on cancer genetic, epigenetic and metabolic derangements that approximate those caused by intra-cellular pathogen infection, a phenomenon referred to as ""viral mimicry"" (VM) and other aspects of cancer/host cells interactions unexplored in the past that enhance the VM effects. On the cancer side, VM prompts alterations of cancer cell metabolism leading to the generation of aberrant cellular products recognized as foreign by the host's immune system. The latter are defined as ""dark matter"" to emphasize the powerful effects exerted by these obscure bioproducts on the TME as the mass of invisible particles can dictate the rotational period of galaxies. On the other side, a myriad of previously unappreciated factors can influence the host responses. Thus, here we propose an extended definition of dark matter beyond the limits of cancer cell-intrinsic biology, to a broader interpretation encompassing elements that influence the cellular networks within the TME.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R

In this context, molecular signatures gained by main components of the tumor microenvironment, such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), have been explored as prognostic and therapeutic tools. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of the significance of CAFs-related gene signatures in breast and prostate cancers still remains to be disclosed. Methods RNA sequencing technology (RNA-seq) was employed to profile and compare the transcriptome of CAFs isolated from patients affected by breast and prostate tumors. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) characterizing breast and prostate CAFs were intersected with data from public datasets derived from bulk RNA-seq profiles of breast and prostate tumor patients. Pathway enrichment analyses allowed us to appreciate the biological significance of the DEGs. K-means clustering was applied to construct CAFs-related gene signatures specific for breast and prostate cancer and to stratify independent cohorts of patients into high and low gene expression clusters. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests were employed to predict differences in the outcome parameters of the clusters of patients. Decision-tree analysis was used to validate the clustering results and boosting calculations were then employed to improve the results obtained by the decision-tree algorithm. Results Data obtained in breast CAFs allowed us to assess a signature that includes 8 genes ( ITGA11 , THBS1 , FN1 , EMP1 , ITGA2 , FYN , SPP1 , and EMP2 ) belonging to pro-metastatic signaling routes, such as the focal adhesion pathway. Survival analyses indicated that the cluster of breast cancer patients showing a high expression of the aforementioned genes displays worse clinical outcomes. Next, we identified a prostate CAFs-related signature that includes 11 genes ( IL13RA2 , GDF7 , IL33 , CXCL1 , TNFRSF19 , CXCL6 , LIFR , CXCL5 , IL7 , TSLP , and TNFSF15 ) associated with immune responses. A low expression of these genes was predictive of poor survival rates in prostate cancer patients. The results obtained were significantly validated through a two-step approach, based on unsupervised (clustering) and supervised (classification) learning techniques, showing a high prediction accuracy (≥ 90%) in independent RNA-seq cohorts. Conclusion We identified a huge heterogeneity in the transcriptional profile of CAFs derived from breast and prostate tumors. Of note, the two novel CAFs-related gene signatures might be considered as reliable prognostic indicators and valuable biomarkers for a better management of breast and prostate cancer patients.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R

Nevertheless, resistance to palbociclib frequently arises, highlighting the need to identify new targets toward more comprehensive therapeutic strategies in BC patients. Methods BC cell lines resistant to palbociclib were generated and used as a model system. Gene silencing techniques and overexpression experiments, real-time PCR, immunoblotting and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies as well as cell viability, colony and 3D spheroid formation assays served to evaluate the involvement of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) in the resistance to palbociclib in BC cells. Molecular docking simulations were also performed to investigate the potential interaction of palbociclib with GPER. Furthermore, BC cells co-cultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from mammary carcinoma, were used to investigate whether GPER signaling may contribute to functional cell interactions within the tumor microenvironment toward palbociclib resistance. Finally, by bioinformatics analyses and k-means clustering on clinical and expression data of large cohorts of BC patients, the clinical significance of novel mediators of palbociclib resistance was explored. Results Dissecting the molecular events that characterize ER-positive BC cells resistant to palbociclib, the down-regulation of ERα along with the up-regulation of GPER were found. To evaluate the molecular events involved in the up-regulation of GPER, we determined that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) interacts with the promoter region of GPER and stimulates its expression toward BC cells resistance to palbociclib treatment. Adding further cues to these data, we ascertained that palbociclib does induce pro-inflammatory transcriptional events via GPER signaling in CAFs. Of note, by performing co-culture assays we demonstrated that GPER contributes to the reduced sensitivity to palbociclib also facilitating the functional interaction between BC cells and main components of the tumor microenvironment named CAFs. Conclusions Overall, our results provide novel insights on the molecular events through which GPER may contribute to palbociclib resistance in BC cells. Additional investigations are warranted in order to assess whether targeting the GPER-mediated interactions between BC cells and CAFs may be useful in more comprehensive therapeutic approaches of BC resistant to palbociclib.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R

GPER expression and signaling have been found to join in the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), even though controversial data have been reported. In present study, we aimed at providing new mechanistic and biological discoveries knocking out (KO) GPER expression by CRISPR/Cas9 technology in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells. GPER KO whole transcriptome respect to wild type (WT) MDA-MB-231 cells was determined through total RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. We ascertained that anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic gene signatures characterize GPER KO MDA-MB-231 cells. Thereafter, we determined that these cells exhibit a reduced proliferative, clonogenic and self-renewal potential along with an increased mitochondria-dependent apoptosis phenotype. In addition, we recognized that decreased cAMP levels trigger the JNK/c-Jun/p53/Noxa axis, which in turn orchestrates the pro-apoptotic effects observed in GPER KO cells. In accordance with these data, survival analyses in TNBC patients of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) dataset indicated that high Noxa expression correlates with improved outcomes in TNBC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GPER KO in TNBC cells impairs the expression and secretion of the well-acknowledged GPER target gene named CTGF, thus resulting in the inhibition of migratory effects in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Overall, the present study provides novel mechanistic and biological insights on GPER KO in TNBC cells suggesting that GPER may be considered as a valuable target in comprehensive therapeutic approaches halting TNBC progression.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R

In addition, RAGE-mediated signaling has been reported to contribute to the metastatic progression of breast cancer (BC), although mechanistic insights are still required. Here, we provide novel findings regarding the transcriptomic landscape and the molecular events through which RAGE may prompt aggressive features in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC. Methods MCF7 and T47D BC cells stably overexpressing human RAGE were used as a model system to evaluate important changes like cell protrusions, migration, invasion and colony formation both in vitro through scanning electron microscopy, clonogenic, migration and invasion assays and in vivo through zebrafish xenografts experiments. The whole transcriptome of RAGE-overexpressing BC cells was screened by high-throughput RNA sequencing. Thereafter, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses allowed the prediction of potential functions of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Flow cytometry, real time-PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence and western blot assays were performed to investigate the molecular network involved in the regulation of a novel RAGE target gene namely EphA3. The clinical significance of EphA3 was explored in the TCGA cohort of patients through the survivALL package, whereas the pro-migratory role of EphA3 signaling was ascertained in both BC cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Statistical analysis was performed by t-tests. Results RNA-seq findings and GSEA analysis revealed that RAGE overexpression leads to a motility-related gene signature in ER-positive BC cells. Accordingly, we found that RAGE-overexpressing BC cells exhibit long filopodia-like membrane protrusions as well as an enhanced dissemination potential, as determined by the diverse experimental assays. Mechanistically, we established for the first time that EphA3 signaling may act as a physical mediator of BC cells and CAFs motility through both homotypic and heterotypic interactions. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that RAGE up-regulation leads to migratory ability in ER-positive BC cells. Noteworthy, our findings suggest that EphA3 may be considered as a novel RAGE target gene facilitating BC invasion and scattering from the primary tumor mass. Overall, the current results may provide useful insights for more comprehensive therapeutic approaches in BC, particularly in obese and diabetic patients that are characterized by high RAGE levels.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are frequently used for implementing reception beamformers, which are crucial for image quality. Traditional coding with hardware description language (HDL) is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, leading to the exploration of high-level synthesis (HLS) as a potential solution. This paper presents a comparative analysis of HLS and HDL in the implementation of delay-and-sum (DAS) and filtered-delay-multiply-and-sum (FDMAS) beamformers on Intel Arria V FPGAs, which are integrated in the ULA-OP 256 research scanner. Both beamformers were developed using Intel Quartus, sharing a common HDL-designed data acquisition layer. The comparison is focused on the firmware development time assessed by source lines of code (SLOC), FPGA resource utilization and maximum clock frequency. The results demonstrate that HLS reduces the HDL SLOC by 70%; however, it consumes over 1.5 times more FPGA resources, and operates with a 20% lower clock frequency. Although both approaches were used to synthesize two parallel beamformers for comparison due to HLS resource constraints, optimal resource usage in HDL enables the synthesis of additional parallel beamformers, potentially doubling the FR and improving timing performance. Thus, while HLS serves as a valuable tool for rapid firmware development, HDL remains essential for applications with stringent performance and resource utilization requirements.",Alessandro Ovidio Paris Ramalli,RMLLSN83R21G999T

The molecular mechanisms regulating OC differentiation in the bone marrow are still partly elusive. Here, we aimed to identify new regulatory circuits and actionable targets by comprehensive proteomic characterization of OCgenesis from mouse bone marrow monocytes, adopting two parallel unbiased comparative proteomic approaches. This work disclosed an unanticipated protein signature of OCgenesis, with most gene products currently unannotated in bone-related functions, revealing broad structural and functional cellular reorganization and divergence from macrophagic immune activity. Moreover, we identified the deubiquitinase UCHL1 as the most upregulated cytosolic protein in differentiating OCs. Functional studies proved it essential, as UCHL1 genetic and pharmacologic inhibition potently suppressed OCgenesis. Furthermore, proteomics and mechanistic dissection showed that UCHL1 supports OC differentiation by restricting the anti-OCgenic activity of NRF2, the transcriptional activator of the canonical antioxidant response, through redox-independent stabilization of the NRF2 inhibitor, KEAP1. Besides offering a valuable experimental framework to dissect OC differentiation, our study discloses the essential role of UCHL1, exerted through KEAP1-dependent containment of NRF2 anti-OCgenic activity, yielding a novel potential actionable pathway against bone loss.",Enrico Milan,MLNNRC85D30H620C

This study proposes a composite indicator to assess individual frailty levels using administrative healthcare data. Given the complex and multidimensional nature of frailty, a multi-outcome approach is adopted. Following an extensive literature review, a set of adverse health events is selected as proxies for frailty. These events were modelled using logistic classifiers, with frailty determinants (associated to adverse health events, selected using a gradient tree boosting) serving as covariates. The sensitivity and specificity of each classifier is used to compose their combined likelihood. From this, we derive an indicator capable of quantifying frailty across the population. The indicator shows robust performance across multiple outcomes and over time. Its primary innovation lies in allowing the use of diverse and outcome-specific sets of frailty determinants without any structural constraint. Overall, we offer an effective tool for quantifying frailty among older adults, potentially supporting health authorities in the prevention of frailty-related adverse events.",PIETRO BELLONI,BLLPTR94E01G224N

In practice, this means identifying both individual areas and clusters of neighbouring areas where mortality is higher than in the rest of the territory. Mortality clusters are commonly detected using spatial scan statistics, which are tools that scan the territory with moving windows and test the presence of excess mortality. However, these techniques often detect spurious clusters or encompass areas not at risk into existing clusters, leading to unreliable epidemiological results. Here, we propose a data-driven initialisation of a generalised linear model scan statistic that improves its specificity and reduces its computational cost. Our strategy consists of identifying individual areas with a significant mortality excess through an improved version of the Besag–York–Mollié model, and using them to initialise the clustering procedure. We investigate the properties of our method with a series of simulation experiments, showing that our proposed initialisation increases clustering specificity relative to standard approaches and also prevents the erroneous inclusion of areas not at risk within clusters of elevated mortality. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed tool for healthcare authorities using a case study on mortality data from the Padua province in northeastern Italy.",Giovanna Boccuzzo,BCCGNN67M66G224Z

Muscle strength and muscle mass are key indicators of muscular function and sarcopenia. While previous research has explored biceps brachii muscle characteristics in isolation, there is a notable gap in comprehensive studies examining the direct correlation between biceps brachii muscle thickness (BMT), as measured by ultrasound, and muscle strength. In community-dwelling elderly individuals following physical capacity evaluations, anthropometric measurements, HGS, bioimpedance analysis, and muscle ultrasound for the measurement of biceps brachii muscle thickness were performed. The study population consisted of 156 participants; ICC for ultrasound measurements resulted in 0.96 and 95% CI 0.95–0.98, indicating excellent reliability. The Kruskal–Wallis analysis revealed that muscle thickness differed between age tertiles in both male ( p = 0.0005) and female populations ( p = 0.001). Regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, BMI, muscle mass in percentage, and comorbidities revealed a significant and independent positive correlation between muscle strength and muscle thickness: R 2 = 0.70, β = 0.9, 95% CI: 0.7–1.2, and p R 2 = 0.17, β = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.1–0.4, and p = 0.005 in female population. Muscle thickness of biceps brachii measured by ultrasound and handgrip strength is characterized by a significant and positive relationship in older adults. In both female and male populations, the reduction of muscle thickness is parallel to increased age. Implementation of noninvasive ultrasound evaluation of muscle thickness could be helpful in the early detection of physical decline associated with the aging process.

Pre-clinical studies, however, suggest a protective role against ischemic brain damage. In this study we analyzed the relationship between serum leptin and adiponectin levels and the onset or progression of brain infarcts in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Methods All data were extracted from the ADNI database. The final population included 566 subjects, with 58 healthy controls, 396 MCI and 112 AD. All patients with available serum leptin and adiponectin levels at baseline were selected. Demographics, neuropsychological test results, CSF biomarkers, regional brain metabolism with FDG-PET data and the number of brain infarcts on longitudinal MRI scans were extracted. Results Leptin levels were significantly lower in patients with MCI than controls at baseline, while adiponectin levels were not different between the groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis at baseline for the presence of brain infarcts showed a predictive value for leptin but not for adiponectin. Multivariate longitudinal analysis showed that age was the only significant predictor of brain infarcts development at 15-year follow-up, while serum leptin and adiponectin levels did not play a role in this population. Discussion The evidence on the pathogenetic or protective role of adipokines on ischemic brain damage is mixed. In this MCI and AD population, serum leptin and adiponectin were not associated with the development of brain infarcts; therefore, these results do not support the use of adipokines as biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in this population.",Giusepppe  Rengo,RNGGPP78S30F839T

We found that the cells forced to enter mitosis with an intact Golgi ribbon showed remarkable cell division defects, including spindle multipolarity and binucleation. The spindle defects were caused by reduced levels at the centrosome of the kinase Aurora-A, a pivotal spindle formation regulator controlled by Golgi segregation. Overexpression of Aurora-A rescued spindle formation, indicating a crucial role of the Golgi-dependent recruitment of Aurora-A at the centrosome.

A comprehensive understanding of the model itself is essential for its effective utilization and optimal application. This article is a practical guide on the use of graphical models to better understand multimorbidity. It provides a tutorial with a focus on the interpretation of the model structure and of the parameter values. In this study, we analyze data related to a cohort of 214,401 individuals, who were assisted by the Local Health Unit of the province of Padova (north-eastern Italy), collecting information from hospital discharge forms. Methods We explain some fundamental concepts, with special attention to the difference between marginal and conditional associations. We emphasize the importance of considering multimorbidity as a network, where the variables involved are part of an interconnected system of interactions, to correct for spurious effects in the analysis. We show how to analyze the network structure learned from the data by introducing and explaining some centrality measures. Finally, we compare the model obtained by adjusting for population characteristics with the results of a stratified analysis. Results Using examples from the estimated model, we demonstrate the key differences between marginal and conditional associations. Specifically, we show that, marginally, all variables appear associated, while this is not the case when considering conditional associations, where many variables appear to be conditionally independent given the others. We present the results from the analysis of centrality indices, revealing that cardiovascular diseases occupy a central position in the network, unlike more peripheral conditions such as sensory organ diseases. Finally, we illustrate the differences between networks estimated in subpopulations, highlighting how disease associations vary across different groups. Conclusion Graphical models are a versatile tool for analyzing multimorbidity, offering insights into disease associations while controlling for the effects of other variables. This paper provides an overview of graphical models without focusing on detailed methodology, highlighting their utility in understanding network structures and potential subgroup differences, such as gender-related variations in multimorbidity patterns.",Giovanna Boccuzzo,BCCGNN67M66G224Z

Primary goals include identifying areas with unexpected changes in mortality rates, studying the relation among multiple diseases, and dividing the analysed territory into clusters based on the observed levels of disease incidence or mortality. In this work, we focus on detecting spatial mortality clusters, that occur when neighbouring areas within a territory exhibit similar mortality levels due to one or more diseases. When multiple causes of death are examined together, it is relevant to identify not only the spatial boundaries of the clusters but also the diseases that lead to their formation. However, existing methods in literature struggle to address this dual problem effectively and simultaneously. To overcome these limitations, we introduce perla, a multivariate Bayesian model that clusters areas in a territory according to the observed mortality rates of multiple causes of death, also exploiting the information of external covariates. Our model incorporates the spatial structure of data directly into the clustering probabilities by leveraging the stick-breaking formulation of the multinomial distribution. Additionally, it exploits suitable global-local shrinkage priors to ensure that the detection of clusters depends on diseases showing concrete increases or decreases in mortality levels, while excluding uninformative diseases. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior inference that consists of closed-form Gibbs sampling moves for nearly every model parameter, without requiring complex tuning operations. This work is primarily motivated by a case study on the territory of a local unit within the Italian public healthcare system, known as ULSS6 Euganea. To demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our methodology, we also validate perla with a series of simulation experiments and an extensive case study on mortality levels in U.S. counties.",Giovanna Boccuzzo,BCCGNN67M66G224Z

The description starts with a brief discussion on the biomechanics of the upper limbs, focusing on the kinematics of pivotal joints (wrist, elbow, shoulder). Subsequently, the existing actuators are systematically reviewed, offering detailed insights into their primary features, operational principles, strengths, weaknesses, and noteworthy applications within the realm of rehabilitation robotics. After the discussion about the actuators, the paper advances by furnishing valuable guidelines for actuators’ selection tailored for upper limb rehabilitation. These guidelines discuss crucial factors, such as the forces required and the natural Range Of Motions (ROMs) of upper limb joints.

Each individual engaged in eight consecutive sessions with a robot manipulator designed with social cues. Our statistical analysis indicates that prolonged interaction with the robot could influence user engagement. Namely, we observed a decrease in positive emotions (affective), a more regulated quantity of motion (behavioral), and a reduced attention on the robot tasks (cognitive).

Despite the wide usage of the term, the meaning of this concept is still characterized by great vagueness. A common approach is to evaluate it through self-reports and observational grids. While the former solution suffers from a time-discrepancy problem, since the perceived engagement is evaluated at the end of the interaction, the latter solution may be affected by the subjectivity of the observers. From the perspective of developing socially intelligent robots that autonomously adapt their behaviors during the interaction, replicating the ability to properly detect engagement represents a challenge in the social robotics community. This systematic review investigates the conceptualization of engagement, starting with the works that attempted to automatically detect it in interactions involving robots and real users (i.e., online surveys are excluded). The goal is to describe the most worthwhile research efforts and to outline the commonly adopted definitions (which define the authors’ perspective on the topic) and their connection with the methodology used for the assessment (if any). The research was conducted within two databases (Web of Science and Scopus) between November 2009 and January 2023. A total of 590 articles were found in the initial search. Thanks to an accurate definition of the exclusion criteria, the most relevant papers on automatic engagement detection and assessment in HRI were identified. Finally, 28 papers were fully evaluated and included in this review. The analysis illustrates that the engagement detection task is mostly addressed as a binary or multi-class classification problem, considering user behavioral cues and context-based features extracted from recorded data. One outcome of this review is the identification of current research barriers and future challenges on the topic, which could be clustered in the following fields: engagement components, annotation procedures, engagement features, prediction techniques, and experimental sessions.",Alessandra Sorrentino,SRRLSN93B50H501T

A less invasive and more portable solution could be represented by a mobile robot that follows the user during the gait activity. The main idea behind this work relies on finding the best robot configuration for less invasive gait analysis with high acceptability from the end users. To this aim, two follow-me configurations have been designed: human-leader (i.e. the robot follows the person from behind), and robot-leader (i.e. robot follows the person from the front). We asked 27 young participants to test both modalities and to evaluate their perception of the robot in 5 domains: comfort, expected conformity, safety, trust, and unobtrusiveness. Additionally, we extracted quantitative parameters related to the walking experience from the data recorded by the platform and we analyzed them in tandem with the qualitative results. The results reported that robot-leader configuration tended to be more appreciated in terms of comfort, trust, and safety. On the contrary, the human-leader configuration is perceived as less obtrusive, less invasive, and in line with users' expectations. Considering the gait assessment application, we expect the human-leader configuration to return more promising and accurate results.",Alessandra Sorrentino,SRRLSN93B50H501T

While the protective effects of estrogens on vascular health have been largely investigated, the impact of endogenous reproductive hormones on platelet function is less clear. In the SHOW (Sexual Hormones and Hemostasis: Observations for Women Health) study, we aimed to assess the association between the levels of endogenous reproductive hormones and in-vivo platelet activation among pre-menopausal healthy female subjects. Methods Serum levels of estradiol, progesterone (PG), testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and in vivo platelet activation markers were quantified at four time-points across the menstrual cycle (day (d) 1, d5 ± 2, d14 ± 2, and d21 ± 2). Results Among 21 healthy participants (mean age: 30 years), significant variations of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) and soluble NOX2-derived peptide (sNOX2-dp) are detected across the menstrual cycle.

TxB2 is associated with FSH across all time-points (F = 6.051, p = .019) and is significantly reduced on d1 in individuals with self-reported heavy menstrual bleeding. Soluble CD40L (sCD40L) changes most significantly in individuals with an ovulatory cycle (i.e. PG ≥ 3 ng/ml at d21). Conclusions In healthy pre-menopausal female subjects, changes of in-vivo platelet activation markers are associated with changes of PG and gonadotropins. These findings suggest the need for caution in the interpretation of platelet biomarkers in clinical studies enrolling pre-menopausal female individuals.",Stefania Basili,BSLSFN61A57H501V

In this context, neuroarchitecture is emerging as an interdisciplinary field that integrates neuroscience, architecture, environmental psychology, and cognitive science, with the aim of providing empirical evidence on how architectural spaces affect the human brain. This study investigates the potential of neuroarchitecture to inform environmental design by clarifying its current conceptual framework, examining its practical applications, and identifying the context in which it is being implemented. Beginning with an in-depth analysis of the definition of neuroarchitecture, its theoretical foundations, and the range of interpretations within the academic community, the study then offers a critical review of its practical applications across various design fields. By presenting a comprehensive overview of this emerging discipline, the study also summarizes the measurement techniques commonly employed in related research and critically evaluates design criteria based on observed human responses. Ultimately, neuroarchitecture represents a promising avenue for creating environments that deliberately enhance psychological and physiological well-being, paving the way toward truly human-centered design. Nevertheless, neuroarchitecture is still an emerging experimental field, which entails significant limitations. The experiments conducted are still limited to virtual reality and controlled experimental contexts. In addition, small and heterogeneous population samples have been tested, without considering human variability.",MARIANGELA PERILLO,PRLMNG96D66F839J

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulators of cellular senescence by affecting the expression of many important genes involved in senescence-associated pathways and processes. Here, we evaluated a panel of lncRNAs associated with senescence for their differential expression between young and senescent human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) and studied the effect of a known senomorphic compound, resveratrol, on the expression of lncRNAs in senescent NHDFs. As markers of senescence, we evaluated cell growth, senescence-associated (SA)-β-Gal staining, and the expression of p21, Lamin B1 and γH2AX. We found that H19 and PURPL were the most altered lncRNAs in replicative, in doxorubicin (DOXO) and ionising radiation (IR)-induced senescence models. We then investigated the function of H19 and PURPL in cell senescence by siRNA-mediated silencing in young and senescent fibroblasts, respectively. Our results showed that H19 knockdown reduced cell viability and induced cell senescence and autophagy of NHDFs through the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; conversely, PURPL silencing reversed senescence by reducing (SA)-β-Gal staining, recovering cell proliferation with an increase of S-phase cells, and reducing the p53-dependent DNA damage response. Overall, our data highlighted the role of H19 and PURPL in the senescent phenotype and suggested that these lncRNAs may have important implications in senescence-related diseases.",Sara Ristori,RSTSRA92D51A851V

It can be used for continuous, ordinal and count responses. In this study, conditional quantiles and prediction intervals estimated through VTM are compared with those of quantile regression. The comparison is based on a set of data-generating models to assess the performance of the two methodologies regarding the coverage and width of prediction intervals. The simulation study encompasses settings with several functional forms and types of errors. In addition, a discrete version of the continuous ranked probability score is proposed as a tool to choose the best link function for the binary models used in the fitting of VTM. In summary, the varying-thresholds model is a flexible methodology that can be broadly applied with light assumptions; it is advantageous over quantile regression when the conditional quantile function is misspecified.",Marta Pittavino,PTTMRT87M50D205Q

We have investigated the molecular determinants of the antiport reaction by using wet and dry lab approaches based on proteoliposome transport assay with WT and site-directed mutants coupled with computational analyses. The transport of [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine, a high-affinity LAT1 substrate, has been assayed on the F400V single and the F400V/K204Q double mutants in comparison with the WT. The F400V mutant showed a strongly impaired antiport function with a concomitant increase of the uniport activity with respect to the WT. The F400V function was scarcely dependent on the pH and was stimulated by cholesterol, similar to previous observations on the WT. The observed impaired stimulation by the countersubstrate was more dramatic in the double mutant that became completely insensitive to the counter-substrate and even trans-inhibited. Molecular dynamics supported the wet lab data showing a much higher degree of mobility of the double mutant, with respect to the WT, indicating the decrease or loss of constraints in the protein conformational changes during the transport cycle.",Mariafrancesca Scalise,SCLMFR84A50M208W

Rovere-Querini",Frontiers in Aging,2025,Frontiers Media SA,journal-article,"Sarcopenia, the age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function, is driven by a convergence of molecular, cellular, hormonal, nutritional, and neurological alterations. Skeletal muscle comprises multinucleated fibers supported by satellite cells—muscle stem cells essential for repair and regeneration. With age, both the structure and function of these components deteriorate: myonuclei become disorganized, gene expression skews toward catabolic, inflammatory, and fibrotic pathways, and satellite cell numbers and activity decline. Concurrently, mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired proteostasis, and vascular rarefaction limit energy availability and regenerative capacity. Neurodegeneration and age-related muscle fibers denervation further exacerbate muscle loss, particularly affecting fast-twitch fibers, and reduce motor unit integrity. These neural deficits, alongside changes at the neuromuscular junction, contribute to functional decline and diminished contractility. Hormonal changes—including reduced levels of growth hormone, testosterone, and IGF-1—undermine anabolic signaling and promote muscle atrophy. Nutritional factors are also pivotal: anorexia of aging and reduced dietary protein intake lead to suboptimal nutrient availability. Compounding this is anabolic resistance, a hallmark of aging muscle, in which higher levels of dietary protein and amino acids are required to stimulate muscle protein synthesis effectively. Physical inactivity and immobility, often secondary to chronic illness or frailty, further accelerate sarcopenia by promoting disuse atrophy. The molecular constraints of sarcopenia are deeply intertwined with non-molecular mechanisms—such as neuromuscular degeneration, hormonal shifts, inadequate nutrition, and reduced physical activity—creating a complex and self-reinforcing cycle that impairs muscle maintenance and regeneration in the elderly. This review synthesizes current evidence on these interconnected factors, highlighting opportunities for targeted interventions to preserve muscle health across the lifespan.",Sarah Damanti,DMNSRH84E58A662Y

Age-and sex-adjusted Cox regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the association with mortality. Results Out of 1,114 participants (median age 72 years, IQR 69–77), 186 were classified as frail by the FI, 13 by the FP and 48 by both definitions. The concordance between the two measures was fair ( κ = 0.26). Thirty-nine individuals died during the follow-up period. The FI showed a stronger association with mortality (HR 75.29, 95% CI 8.12–697.68, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the FP (HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.45–7.51, p = 0.004).

Based on a person-centered and bio-psycho-social model, the study analyzes the interaction between frail users, caregivers, and the living space, with the aim of identifying the spatial and technological requirements necessary to support care activities in an integrated manner. The research methodology began with an analysis of user needs, with the goal of identifying environmental and technological requirements that characterize spaces used for home care. The outcomes of this process led to the definition of operational guidelines to support the design of adaptations in the areas most involved in care activities. These include recommendations for ensuring safety, comfort, usability, maintainability, and the integrability of assistive technologies, as well as the proposal of alternative design solutions for adaptation, which are qualitatively assessed based on their construction impact and compatibility with existing constraints. Such solutions aim to address the needs of both care recipients and caregivers in an integrated way, while promoting ageing-in-place even in conditions of reduced self-sufficiency. The study highlights the importance of a proactive and multidisciplinary approach to designing “care-ready” environments capable of responding to the evolving housing and health needs of the population.",Tiziana Ferrante,FRRTZN65R52D643E

The discussion focused on the latest international approaches to sustainability, as applied to the fields of planning, architecture, and design, and interpreted through the principles of the New European Bauhaus (NEB).Hence, focusing on novel design, operational and cultural strategies, aligned with the three pillars of the New European Bauhaus (NEB)-Sustainability, namely Aesthetics, Inclusion and a human-centred vision, can provide insights into rethinking the very meaning of sustainability, which is increasingly invoked while being at risk of becoming a mere slogan or rhetorical device. In the current context, the ecological transition and its social and cultural implications need to bridge the widening gap between institutional declarations and the everyday practices of citizens. This requires moving beyond a purely technical view of sustainability that lacks its ethical and social dimensions. The trajectory initiated with the “Beyond all Limits” Conference and continued in this Special Issue of TECHNE aims to investigate underexplored themes of sustainability, viewed as a cultural, social, and political act capable of renewing-through the experimental dimension of design disciplines-not only the forms of the built environment but also the deeper meaning of our contemporary living.",Tiziana Ferrante,FRRTZN65R52D643E

This study proposes a Frailty Index based on administrative health data, with the aim of facilitating informed decision-making and resource allocation in population health management. The aim of this work is to develop a Frailty Index that 1) accurately predicts multiple adverse health outcomes, 2) comprises a parsimonious set of variables, 3) aggregates variables without predefined weights, 4) regenerates when applied to different populations, and 5) relies solely on routinely collected administrative data. Using administrative data from a local health authority in Italy, we identified two cohorts of individuals aged $\ge$65 years. A set of six adverse outcomes (death, emergency room access with highest priority, hospitalisation, disability onset, dementia onset, and femur fracture) was selected to define frailty. Variable selection was performed using logistic regression modelling and a forward approach based on partially ordered set (POSET) theory. The final Frailty Index comprised eight variables: age, disability, total number of hospitalisations, mental disorders, neurological diseases, heart failure, kidney failure, and cancer. The Frailty Index performs well or very well for all adverse outcomes (AUC range: 0.664-0.854) except hospitalisation (AUC: 0.664). The index also captured associations between frailty and chronic diseases, comorbidities, and socioeconomic deprivation. This study presents a validated, parsimonious Frailty Index based on routinely collected administrative data. The proposed approach offers a comprehensive toolkit for stratifying populations by frailty level, facilitating targeted interventions and resource allocation in population health management.",Maurizio Nicolaio,NCLMRZ98R13E919H

The relationship between frailty, obesity, and polymorphism remains inadequately explored. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) offer insights into genetic predispositions that may influence the development of both frailty and obesity. Methods We aimed at investigating whether SNPs associated with frailty also play a role in obesity. Data were collected from the FRASNET cross-sectional study, which included community-dwelling older individuals residing in Milan and nearby areas. Participants were recruited through random sampling. They underwent multidimensional geriatric assessments, which included the collection of blood samples for SNP analysis. Frailty was assessed using the frailty index, and body composition was evaluated using bioelectrical impedance analysis and anthropometric measures. Results SNPs related to frailty and linked to the renin–angiotensin system (CYP11B2 rs1799998, AGT rs5051, and AGTR1 rs2131127), apoptosis pathways (CASP8 rs6747918), growth hormone signaling (GHR rs6180), inflammation (TLR4 rs5030717, CD33 rs3865444, and FN1 rs7567647), adducin (ADD3 rs3731566), and the 9p21–23 region (rs518054) were found to be associated with various measures of obesity in community-dwelling older adults. Conclusions Frailty-related SNPs contribute to obesity in community-dwelling older adults. We identified a novel association between adducin SNPs and visceral fat, which has not been previously reported. Detecting genetic predispositions to obesity and frailty early could aid in identifying individuals at risk, facilitating the adoption of preventive interventions.

Methods: narrative review to describe the mechanisms and management of acute sarcopenia. Results: The prevalence of acute sarcopenia ranges from 28% to 69%, likely underdiagnosed due to the absence of muscle mass and function assessments in most clinical settings. Systemic inflammation, immune–endocrine dysregulation, and anabolic resistance are identified as key pathophysiological factors. Interventions include early mobilization, resistance exercise, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and nutritional strategies such as protein supplementation, leucine, β-hydroxy-β-methyl-butyrate, omega-3 fatty acids, and creatine monohydrate. Pharmaceuticals show variable efficacy. Conclusions: Future research should prioritize serial monitoring of muscle parameters, identification of predictive biomarkers, and the involvement of multidisciplinary teams from hospital admission to address sarcopenia.

Methods Using data from Wave 8 (2019-2020) of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we estimated the prevalence of kinlessness among individuals aged 65 and over in 26 European countries and Israel. We considered different definitions of kinlessness, from a less restrictive (based on the absence of both a partner and children) to a more restrictive one (absence of partner, children, grandchildren, parents, and siblings). Results Kinlessness varied considerably across countries. The percentage of people aged 65 and over who lacked a partner and children ranged between 2-3.5% in the Czech Republic, Romania, Israel, and Bulgaria to more than 8% in Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, and Malta. The percentage of older people lacking all close kin considered (partner, children, grandchildren, parents, and siblings) ranged from 0.1 to 4.1%. In addition, there was substantial heterogeneity in kinlessness in some countries by age, sex, and rurality of the residential area, whereas, except for a few cases, we did not find significant differences by education.

MASLD often progresses to liver fibrosis, posing significant health risks. Age-independent, noninvasive tools to evaluate fibrosis are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy across all age groups. Eighty-four inflammatory, hematological, and metabolic variables were quantified in the blood of 63 individuals with MASLD, with varying degrees of fibrosis, and 22 age-matched controls. Linear regression models were used to identify markers strongly correlated with liver fibrosis that were not influenced by age. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the ability of various indices to discriminate between no/mild and severe liver fibrosis. Glutamine and propionate levels were identified as strongly correlated with fibrosis but not with age and were combined to form the GP index. The GP index demonstrated superior predictive power for liver fibrosis compared to existing scores, like FIB-4 and FIB-3. The study introduces the GP index, a novel metabolite-based score for diagnosing and monitoring liver fibrosis in patients with MASLD, which demonstrated robust performance irrespective of patient age in this cohort.

These advances aim to address a range of challenges facing the healthcare system. Among emerging digital health technologies, portable devices play a crucial role by enabling continuous and personalized health monitoring, reducing the need for direct medical supervision. This study proposes the development of a portable device for the real-time monitoring of cardiovascular health through the acquisition of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The proposed system includes highly sensitive sensors such as the MAX30003 for ECG and the MAX30102 for PPG, both processed by an ESP32 microcontroller. The device is characterized by its compact, lightweight design and ease of use, requiring only simple finger placement on built-in electrodes to acquire signals. Data is acquired and processed using MATLAB for visualization and Neurokit2 for quantitative analysis. The system was validated through an experimental protocol involving 19 participants, comparing its performance to a standard medical-grade electrocardiograph. The results indicate promising accuracy in detecting PR intervals, QRS complex duration, and QT intervals, with percentage errors of 22.9%, 9%, and 27%, respectively, while the RR interval and BPM showed lower deviations of 11% and 10%. PR, QRS and RR intervals demonstrated good agreement with reference measurements but the QT interval exhibited greater variability, likely due to challenges in T-wave detection. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed these findings, highlighting the need for further refinement of T-wave identification algorithms. Future work will aim to enhance T-wave detection accuracy, refine signal processing, and validate the device on a larger population. Additionally, PPG signal evaluation will be explored to expand its applications in non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring.",Stefania Basili,BSLSFN61A57H501V

The Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), a readily available marker of systemic inflammation, has been linked to short-term adverse outcomes in LC, but data on long-term follow-up are limited. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between NLR and long-term all-cause mortality in an unselected cohort of LC patients. Methods Data were gathered from the Italian multicenter observational study “PRO-LIVER”. Patients with available data to calculate NLR at baseline were included. Baseline clinical determinants of NLR and the association of NRL with all-cause mortality at 2-year follow-up were evaluated. Results From the overall cohort ( n = 753), 506 patients with LC (31% female, mean age 64.8 ± 11.9 years) were included in the analysis. Median value of NLR was 2.42 (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 1.61–3.52). At baseline, patients with NLR ≥ 2.42 were more likely to have Child–Pugh B or C, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or portal vein thrombosis (PVT). After a median follow-up of 21 months, 129 patients died: 44 (17%) with NLR p p = 0.012), along with age, Child–Pugh C class, HCC and PVT. Conclusions NLR is associated with long-term all-cause mortality in LC. NLR may serve as a potentially easily available tool to aid risk refinement in LC.

MASLD often progresses to liver fibrosis, posing significant health risks. Age-independent non-invasive tools to evaluate fibrosis are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy across all age groups. Methods. 84 inflammatory, hematological, and metabolic variables were quantified in the blood of n = 63 individuals with MASLD with different degrees of fibrosis and n = 22 age-matched controls. Linear regression models were employed to identify markers strongly correlated with liver fibrosis but not influenced by age. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the ability of various indexes to discriminate between no/mild and severe liver fibrosis. Results. Levels of glutamine and propionate were identified as strongly correlated to fibrosis but not age and combined to form the GP index. The GP index demonstrated superior predictive power for liver fibrosis compared to existing scores, like circulating creatinine. It showed higher discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.872) and better model fit, indicating its robustness and reliability across all age groups. Conclusions. The study introduces the GP index, an age-independent tool for diagnosing and monitoring liver fibrosis in MASLD patients. By excluding age-dependent markers, the GP index can potentially reduce false positives and improve diagnostic accuracy, particularly in older populations.

Aim To develop an interpretable machine learning (ML) model to gain insight on the clinical, functional, biological and psychosocial features playing a major role in the supervised prediction of non-obstructive versus obstructive CAD. Methods From the EVA study, we analyzed a consecutive unselected cohort of adults hospitalized for IHD undergoing coronary angiography. Non-obstructive CAD was defined by a coronary stenosis at the angiogram &lt;50%. Baseline clinical and psycho-socio-cultural characteristics were used for computing a frailty index based on Rockwood and Mitnitsky model, and gender score according to GENESIS-PRAXY methodology. The serum concentration of inflammatory cytokines was measured with a multiplex flow cytometric assay. An XGBoost classifier combined to an explainable artificial intelligence tool (SHAP) was employed to identify the most influential features in discriminating obstructive versus non-obstructive CAD. Results Among the overall EVA cohort (n=509), 311 individuals (mean age 67±11 years, 38% females; 67% obstructive CAD) with complete data were analyzed. The ML-based model (83% accuracy and 87% precision) revealed that while obstructive CAD associated with higher frailty index (i.e., lower physiological reserve), older age and a cytokine signature characterized by IL-1β, IL-12p70 and IL-33, non-obstructive CAD was more likely associated with higher gender score (i.e., social characteristics traditionally ascribed to women, regardless of biological sex) and with a cytokine signature characterized by IL-18, IL-8, IL-23. Conclusions Integrating clinical, biological and psycho-social features, we have optimized a sex- and gender-unbiased model that discriminates obstructive and non-obstructive CAD. Further mechanistic studies will shed light on the biological plausibility of the observed associations. Funding Acknowledgement Type of funding sources: Public Institution(s).

Methods: Med-diet adherence was evaluated among 503 consecutive adults with IHD. MACEs were collected during a long-term follow-up. Results: Male Bem Sex-Role Inventory score (i.e., male personality traits) and physical functional capacity were associated with higher adherence, while cohabitation with a smoker and physical inactivity with poorer adherence. During a median follow-up of 22 months, 48 participants experienced MACEs (17.5%, 8.1%, and 3.9% of patients with low, medium, and high adherence, respectively; p = 0.016).

Early and accurate diagnosis, as well as effective risk stratification, are essential for optimizing clinical management and improving patient outcomes. In this context, biomarkers have gained increasing interest in recent years as they can provide important diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with AHF. Aim and Methods: The primary objective of the present study was to compare the levels of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), and C-reactive protein (CRP) between patients diagnosed with acute heart failure (AHF) and those without AHF and sepsis. Furthermore, the study aimed to assess the diagnostic and prognostic value of the use of a multimarker approach in AHF patients. To achieve these objectives, a total of 145 patients with AHF and 127 patients without AHF and sepsis, serving as the control group, were consecutively enrolled in the study. Results: Levels of MR-proADM (median: 2.07; (25th–75th percentiles: 1.40–3.02) vs. 1.11 (0.83–1.71) nmol/L, p 10,132 pg/mL (hazard ratio (HR) 2.97; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.13–7.82; p = 0.0284) and levels of MR-proADM > 2.8 nmol/L (HR: 8.57; CI: 2.42–30.28; p = 0.0009) predicted mortality. The combined use of MR-proADM and NT-proBNP provided significant additive predictive value for mortality and new re-admission for AHF at 30 days after discharge. A logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of NT-proBNP pg/mL > 12,973 pg mL and/or MR-proADM > 4.2 nmol/L predicted hospital re-admission within 30 days (OR: 3.23; CI: 1.05–9.91; p = 0.041). Conclusion: The combined assay of MR-proADM and NT-proBNP could be helpful in accurately identifying AHF and in defining prognosis and re-admission for AHF. The complementary use of these biomarkers can provide a useful clinical evaluation of AHF while also orienting clinicians to the pathophysiology underlying heart damage and assisting them in tailoring therapy.",Stefania Basili,BSLSFN61A57H501V

Using the 1958 National Child Development Study, we explore how self-rated health (SRH) and body mass index (BMI) at age 23 relate to achievement of fertility goals by age 46. We find that worse SRH and a BMI outside the healthy range at age 23 are strongly associated with lower fertility and underachieving fertility goals. While poor SRH is associated with lower fertility mostly among men, BMI outside the healthy range at 23 is more significant for women. Additional analyses indicate that employment and union history partly mediate the effect of health on fertility, but health retains a substantive direct effect. Our findings suggest that health in early adulthood is an important determinant, whether direct or indirect, of family life-course trajectories.

This study investigates the dynamics of overqualification (i.e., when workers have higher qualifications than their job requires) and job satisfaction among migrants, taking Italy – a country with one of the world’s oldest populations and a highly segmented labour market – as a case study. We pursue three main goals: (1) to examine the risk of overqualification by migrant background, (2) to analyse how overqualification relates to job satisfaction by migrant status, and (3) to test whether the relationship between the two differs among older natives and migrants. We pay particular attention to migrants’ age at arrival – a key factor that can profoundly shape labour market experiences through such mechanisms as educational pathways and integration trajectories. The results show that migrants, especially those who arrived in Italy as adults, face a significantly higher risk of overqualification than natives. However, the negative association between overqualification and job satisfaction is weaker among this group, and particularly among older adult migrants. These findings suggest the emergence of an ‘overqualification/job satisfaction paradox’, whereby those most exposed to job mismatch appear less affected by its negative consequences. This may be driven by psychological mechanisms – such as adaptation to lower expectations – as well as by selection processes, whereby migrants with more negative experiences may have already exited the host labour market.",ELEONORA TRAPPOLINI,TRPLNR89L67C773O

The number of employees over 50 doubled in twenty years: from 4.3 million in 2000 to 9 million in 2023. This trend does not result from greater demand for this kind of worker but depends mainly on population ageing and increasing pension age. In this new scenario, social partners can play a key role in developing an age-sensitive approach to the regulation of employee relations through sectoral bargaining. That is, an approach aimed at supporting the quality and productivity of employees over 50. The paper aims at verifying whether social partners have developed an age-sensitive approach to labour regulation by promoting measures and practices to increase the quality of employment of employees over 50. We analysed the 25 most important sectoral agreements (CCNL) in Italy by coverage. The contracts cover 1.6 million enterprises and 14.9 million workers, respectively, 77.2% and 72.5% of the total. We selected all the voluntaristic provisions specifically focusing on age. The results show that Italian social partners do not extensively deal with the potential risks and opportunities represented by prolonged working careers. Only 11 out of 25 CCNL contain age-related provisions, and no comprehensive approach regulating the consequences of the workforce ageing process has been found in any sectoral agreement. Clauses are mostly targeted to give a conceptual framework to guide employers and social partners in company bargaining. No mature older worker-focused clauses related to training, time flexibilization, work accommodation or workload reduction have been found in the agreements. Most importantly, when target mature workers, provisions aim at reducing older workers’ activity in preparation for retirement. On the other hand, intergenerational collaboration-related provisions assume mature worker turnover, e.g., in the case of intergenerational relay and knowledge transfer. The paper emphasizes that workforce ageing is a topic that is as relevant as it is neglected by collective bargaining in Italy. The postponement of the retirement age is a necessary but insufficient condition for the social partners to develop a specific attention to the working conditions of employees over 50.",Dario Raspanti,RSPDRA87D18D612N

The regulation of LAT1 function and stability by cholesterol was previously described in ex vivo and in vitro experimental models. The complexity of the relationship between LAT1 and cholesterol has been further studied by investigating the impact of selected oxidized forms of cholesterol, focusing on the most abundant auto-oxidized form of cholesterol, namely 7-ketocholesterol, which increases with age and pathologies characterized by high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The partial substitution of cholesterol with 7-ketocholesterol in HEK293 cells transiently overexpressing the human LAT1 (HEK293-LAT1), decreases the Vmax of LAT1 mediated transport and the thermal stability of the protein. The impairing effect on transport was directly tested in LAT1 reconstituted proteoliposomes supplemented with 7-ketocholesterol. In this experimental model, it was found that the presence of 7-ketocholesterol altered the transport stimulation by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), as previously described. This was likely due to the higher rigidity of 7-ketocholesterol compared to cholesterol, which alters the membrane/protein interaction, weakening the ATP binding to LAT1. LAT1 transport function was also inhibited when proteoliposomes were supplemented with 7α-hydroxycholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol. These deleterious effects may be relevant in chronic pathological conditions characterized by altered cholesterol/oxysterol ratios, ranging from metabolic syndrome to kidney disease and neurological disorders.",Mariafrancesca Scalise,SCLMFR84A50M208W

The antiport reaction of LAT1 is crucial at the BBB since its inherited loss causes Autism Spectrum Disorder. We have investigated the possible molecular determinant of the antiport by site-directed mutagenesis, in vitro transport assay and computational analysis. Previous data indicated that mutation of K204 impairs, but does not knock-out LAT1 functionality. We have investigated the activity changes in the K204Q mutant by following the transport of [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine, one of the major substrates, in proteoliposomes harbouring the WT or K204Q. In the mutant, the [<sup>3</sup>H]-histidine uptake and efflux are not more stimulated by the counter-substrate as they occur in the WT. Moreover, the mutation strongly decreases the substrate affinity and alters the pH dependence of K204Q. Molecular Dynamics analysis correlates well with the experimental data since it shows that substrate prematurely escapes the binding site. In addition, the K204Q shows a strongly increased mobility in those regions, transmembrane domains and random coils, involved in the transport cycle.

The riskiness of these particles is also linked to the release of other contaminants, such as heavy metals. Solute Carriers (SLCs) represent eminent examples of first-level targets of heavy metals due to their localization on the cell surface. Putative targets of heavy metals are the organic cation transporters that form a sub-clade of the SLC22 family. Besides the physiological role in the absorption/release of endogenous organic cations, these transporters are crucial in drug disposition and their interaction with xenobiotics. In this work, the human SLC22A4, commonly known as OCTN1, was used as a benchmark to test interactions with heavy metals released by microplastics, exploiting the proteoliposome tool. The potency of metals to interfere with the OCTN1 function has been evaluated by measuring IC50 values calculated in the micromolar range. The molecular mechanism of interaction has been defined using site-directed mutagenesis and computational analyses. Finally, some chemical and physiological thiol-reacting compounds show the capacity to rescue the metal-inhibited OCTN1 function.

The CAC has a couple of Cys residues (C136 and C155) most reactive toward ROS and redox signaling compounds such as GSH, NO, and H2S. Among physiological compounds reacting with Cys, itaconate is produced during inflammation and represents the connection between oxidative metabolism and immune responses. The possible interaction between the CAC and itaconate has been investigated. Methods: the modulatory effects of itaconate on the transport activity of the native and recombinant CAC were tested using the proteoliposome experimental model together with site-directed mutagenesis and computational analysis. Results: Itaconate reacts with the CAC causing irreversible inhibition. Dose–response experiment performed with the native and recombinant protein showed IC50 for itaconate of 11 ± 4.6 mM and 8.4 ± 2.9 mM, respectively. The IC50 decreased to 3.8 ± 1.0 mM by lowering the pH from pH 7.0 to pH 6.5. Inhibition kinetics revealed a non-competitive type of inhibition. C136 is the main target of itaconate, as demonstrated by the increased IC50 of mutants in which this Cys was substituted by Val. The central role of C136 was confirmed by covalent docking. Administration of dimethyl itaconate to HeLa cells inhibited the CAC transport activity, suggesting that itaconate could react with the CAC also in intact cells.",Mariafrancesca Scalise,SCLMFR84A50M208W

Given this concern, it is crucial to assess aging biomarkers and their correlation with the HIV reservoir in order to comprehensively characterize and monitor these individuals. Fifty-five PHIVAYA (median age: 23, interquartile range [IQR]: 20–27 years, and 21 [18–23] years on ART at the time of study sampling) were studied along with 23 age-matched healthy controls. The PHIVAYA exhibited significantly higher percentages of activated, senescent, exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, shorter telomeres, reduced thymic output, and higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers (PAMPs, DAMPs, and pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα) as well as denervation biomarkers (neural cell adhesion molecule 1 [NCAM1] and C-terminal Agrin fragment [CAF]), compared to controls. HIV-DNA levels positively correlated with activated, senescent, exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, circulating biomarkers levels, and inversely with regulatory T and B cells and telomere length. According to their viremia over time, PHIVAYA were subgrouped into 14 Not Suppressed (NS)-PHIVAYA and 41 Suppressed (S)-PHIVAYA, of whom 6 who initiated ART within one year of age and maintained sustained viral suppression overtime were defined as Early Suppressed (ES)-PHIVAYA and the other 35 as Late Suppressed (LS)-PHIVAYA. ES-PHIVAYA exhibited significantly lower HIV-DNA reservoir, decreased percentages of senescent and exhausted CD4 and CD8 T cells, reduced levels of circulating inflammatory and denervation biomarkers, but longer telomere compared to LS- and NS-PHIVAYA. They differed significantly from healthy controls only in a few markers, including higher percentages of regulatory T and B cells, and higher levels of DAMPs. Overall, these results underscore the importance of initiating ART early and maintaining viral suppression to limit the establishment of the viral reservoir and to counteract immune and cellular premature aging. These findings also suggest new approaches for minimally invasive monitoring of individuals at high risk of developing premature aging and age-related illnesses.",Silvia Giunco,GNCSLV73S56D325X

Reduced muscle strength, either in terms of quantity or quality, and poor physical performance are among the criteria used to diagnose it. The current gold standard methods to evaluate sarcopenia are limited in terms of their cost, required expertise, and portability. A possible alternative for sarcopenia detection and monitoring is surface electromyography, which offers comprehensive information on muscle function, but a systematic synthesis of the existing literature is lacking. This systematic review aims to evaluate the application of sEMG in diagnosing and monitoring sarcopenia, focusing on the muscles involved, signal processing techniques, artificial intelligence models, and statistical analysis methods used for data interpretation. Following PRISMA guidelines, a search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and IEEE databases from 2014 up to December 2024. Original studies using sEMG for sarcopenia diagnosis or assessment in older populations were included. After removing duplicates, 145 articles were identified, of which 18 were included in the final analysis. The findings indicate a growing interest in the adoption of sEMG in sarcopenia assessment. However, methodological heterogeneity among studies limits comparability. sEMG represents a promising option for the early detection of sarcopenia, but standardized guidelines for data collection and interpretation are needed.

Monitoring gait is crucial for the early detection of abnormalities, such as toe walking, which is characterized by limited or absent heel contact with the floor during walking. Persistent toe walking can cause severe foot, ankle, and musculature conditions; poor balance; increased risk of falling or tripping; and can affect overall quality of life, making it difficult, for example, to participate in sports or social activities. This study proposes a new approach to detect toe walking using surface Electromyography (sEMG) on lower limbs. sEMG sensors, by measuring the electrical activity of muscles, can see signals before the movement corresponding to muscle activation, contributing to an early detection of a possible problem. The sEMG signal presents significant complexity due to its noisy nature and the challenge of extracting meaningful features for classification. To address this issue and enhance the model’s robustness across different devices and configurations, a Transfer Learning (TL) approach is introduced. This method leverages pre-trained models to effectively handle the variability of sEMG data and improve classification accuracy. In particular, Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is applied to sEMG-filtered signals (with time windows of 1 s) to convert them into 2D images (scalograms). Preliminary tests were performed on a public dataset using some of the most well-known pre-trained architectures, obtaining an accuracy of about 95% on InceptionResNetV2.",Andrea MANNI,MNNNDR75L21B936A

Thus, most US elderly keep their out-of-pocket medical expenses close to a satiation point that varies with health. Consumption responds to health shocks mostly because adverse health shocks reduce the marginal utility of consumption.

According to neurophysiological evidence, the easiest reliable way to render a virtual softness is to generate purely tactile (as opposed to kinaesthetic) feedback to be delivered via a finger-pulp-interfaced deformable surface. Moreover, it is necessary to control not only the skin indentation depth by applying quasi-static (non-vibratory) contact pressures, but also the skin contact area. This is typically impossible with available devices, even with those that can vary the contact area, because the latter cannot be controlled due to the complexity of sensing it at high resolutions. This causes indetermination on an important tactile cue to render softness. Here, we present a technology that allows the contact area to be open-loop controlled via personalised optical calibrations. We demonstrate the solution on a modified, pneumatic wearable tactile display of softness previously described by us, consisting of a small chamber containing a transparent membrane inflated against the finger pulp. A window on the device allowed for monitoring the skin contact area with a camera from an external unit to generate a calibration curve by processing photos of the skin membrane interface at different pressures. The solution was validated by comparisons with an ink-stain-based method. Moreover, to avoid manual calibrations, a preliminary automated procedure was developed. This calibration strategy may be applied also to other kinds of displays where finger pulps are in contact with transparent deformable structures.",Federico Carpi,CRPFRC75B10G702O

Using a rich 10-year population-level panel, we estimate a fixed-effects model to analyze HCE patterns for different health care services and by primary disease. Our main findings indicate that the effect of age on total HCE is lower when morbidity is controlled for while it increases when we also condition on TTD. This indicates that, compared to those incurred at older ages, earlier deaths are associated with higher HCE. At younger ages, increased expenditures are also observed as the severity of the health condition deteriorates. We also show that expenses for out-of-hospital services mainly drive the evolution of total HCE by age, while inpatient expenses are primarily determined by morbidity and TTD. In the end-of-life period, hospital costs continue to rise, whereas expenses incurred for all other services fall sharply in the year of death. We prove that expenses for long-lasting conditions start to increase long before death, while those for acute conditions grow exponentially only in the last two years of life. Our work contributes to informing cost-containment policies through a better understanding of HCE evolution during the life cycle and in the last years of life.",CLAUDIO LUCIFORA,LCFCLD60B21H501N

This study investigated the association between TTV viremia and all-cause mortality risk over seven years in a hospitalized older cohort, and its relationship with inflammatory markers including osteopontin (OPN) and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15). Data from 956 patients were analyzed, with high TTV load defined as ≥5 log DNA copies/mL. High TTV viremia was significantly associated with increased mortality risk at 1, 3, and 7 years independently of age, sex, comorbidities, and inflammatory markers. In stratified analyses, this association was significant at one year in both males and females, but persisted at three and seven years only in males. The strongest association was observed in participants aged 80-89 years, remaining significant across all follow-up periods. When patients were stratified by a composite immune score reflecting degrees of immunosenescence, high TTV viremia predicted increased mortality among those with intermediate or severe immune dysfunction, persisting up to seven years in the most immunosenescent subgroup. Patients with elevated TTV loads exhibited increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), decreased serum albumin and hemoglobin, and significantly higher plasma levels of OPN and GDF15, whereas IL-10 tended to decrease. No significant differences were observed for neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, IL-6, CD163, CCL22, or CXCL9 between high and low TTV viremia groups.

We previously showed that cfDNA levels and integrity can predict survival in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease. Here, we aimed to clarify whether a low-pass next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach can characterize the repeat content of cfDNA. Considering the bimodal distribution of cfDNA fragment lengths, we examined the occurrence of repetitive DNA subfamilies separately in dinucleosomal (>250 bp) and mononucleosomal (≤250 bp) cfDNA sequences from 24 patients admitted for heart failure. An increase in the relative abundance of Alu repetitive elements was observed in the longer fraction, while alpha satellites were enriched in the mononucleosomal fraction. The relative abundance of Alu, ALR, and L1HS DNA in the dinucleosomal fraction correlated with different prognostic biomarkers, and Alu DNA was negatively associated with the presence of chronic kidney disease comorbidity. These results, together with the observed inverse correlation between Alu DNA abundance and cfDNA integrity, suggest that the composition of plasma cfDNA could be determined by multiple mechanisms in different physio-pathological conditions. In conclusion, low-pass NGS is an inexpensive method to analyze the cfDNA repeat landscape and identify new cardiovascular disease biomarkers.",Fabiola Olivieri,LVRFBL68R52D007H

The clinical utility of these technologies for health is well established, but there is limited understanding of psychological and emotional processes that sustain long-term engagement with these technologies. This qualitative study investigates how individuals with hypertension experience and attribute meaning to their engagement with digital self-monitoring tools. Methods McCarron’s engagement model—specifically the “retain” phase—and Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis were used to analyze 35 semi-structured interviews with adults who used ICT-enabled blood pressure monitors and smart scales. Results In the retain phase, engagement in DHIs is characterized by 3 main themes: (1) Reassurance and Sense of Control Over Health Status through Digital Tools; (2) Engaged but Ambivalent and Anxious: The Emotional Cost of Monitoring; (3) Connected Through Data as Numbers Redefine the Therapeutic Dialog. Discussion From the results we identified five psychological functions of engagement with digital monitoring tools, each showing both functional and non-functional or ambivalent expression. Engagement with DHIs cannot be reduced to simple observable behavior, but must be understood as a dynamic, iterative and situated process, supported by the regulatory functions in the context of self-care. Clinicians, psychologists, and designers are therefore called upon to recognize and value the psychological functions implicit in DHIs in order to promote truly sustainable, meaningful, and person-centered care practices and engagement.",DANIELA LEMMO,LMMDNL87R58F839S

Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) provided several technological solutions to contrast ageing and its consequences, combining different technological paradigms and assistive devices to support older adults. However, AAL solutions often require users' domestic environments modifications and a careful selection of assistive devices to effectively support end users. These tasks are far from trivial and can pose a challenge for architects and designers. This work introduces a semantic-based reconfigurator to support designers and architects in reconfiguring the domestic environments for older adults who may benefit from AAL technologies. The reconfigurator acts as a Decision Support System (DSS) since it identifies the AAL solutions to be deployed (leveraging semantic representations of the devices and of the inhabitant's health condition), then it interacts with a 3D model of the inhabitant's room, enabling designers and architects to evaluate the configuration of devices, furniture, and the performance of building elements, taking into account physical environment's constraints. The proposed solution is illustrated with two use cases, each involving a different older adult with specific needs and illustrates the reasoning process.",Tiziana Ferrante,FRRTZN65R52D643E

However, its long-term prognostic role in type 2 diabetes (T2D) remains underexplored. This study evaluated the predictive value of the TyG index for all-cause mortality and MACE in T2D over a period of more than 15 years. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 568 patients with T2D (median age: 67 years, IQR 61–72 years; 54% males; median disease duration: 14 years, IQR 7–21 years; median HbA1c: 7.3%, IQR 6.6–8.0%) and 376 presumably healthy controls (CTR, median age: 65 years, IQR 60–71 years) followed for a median period of 16.8 (IQR, 13.1–16.8) years. Routine biomarkers were measured on serum samples using commercially available methods. One-way ANOVA/ANCOVA, logistic regression, and Spearman’s correlations were used to compare the TyG index among groups and to assess its correlations with biochemical variables. The association between TyG index and the follow-up endpoints was investigated by Kaplan–Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards analysis. Results Patients with T2D exhibited higher TyG Index values compared to CTR, with significant correlations between the TyG Index and markers of obesity, glucose metabolism, inflammation, and liver function. Patients with preexisting diabetic kidney disease (DKD) or atherosclerotic vascular disease had higher baseline values of TyG index. Sex-specific differences were observed among CTR but not in T2D patients. The TyG Index was predictive of all-cause mortality (HR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.07–1.79) and associated with the onset of complications MACE, DKD, and neuropathy independent of other conventional predictors. Age modified the TyG Index-mortality association, with the strongest effect in individuals aged 57–74. Conclusion The TyG index is a valuable prognostic marker for long-term risk of all-cause mortality and MACE in patients with T2D, supporting its use in clinical risk stratification.",Fabiola Olivieri,LVRFBL68R52D007H

We recently hypothesized the role of Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) imbalance in this context. Studies on ANS functions during aging highlighted an imbalance towards heightened sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity, instigating a proinflammatory milieu, and attenuated parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) function, which exerts anti-inflammatory effects via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP) and suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This scenario strongly suggests that ANS imbalance can fuel inflammaging, now recognized as one of the most relevant risk factors for age-related disease development. Recent recommendations have increasingly highlighted the need for actionable strategies to improve the quality of life for older adults by identifying biomarkers that can be easily measured, even in asymptomatic individuals. We advocate for considering ANS imbalance as a biomarker of aging and inflammaging. Measures of ANS imbalance, such as heart rate variability (HRV), are relatively affordable, non-invasive, and cost-effective, making this hallmark easily diagnosable. HRV gains renewed significance within the aging research landscape, offering a tangible link between pathophysiological perturbations and age-related health outcomes.",Fabiola Olivieri,LVRFBL68R52D007H

A wide range of motor and non-motor symptoms characterizes them. It is evident that in the modern era, the use of smart wrist devices, such as smartwatches, wristbands, and smart bracelets is spreading among all categories of people. This diffusion is justified by the limited costs, ease of use, and less invasiveness (and consequently greater acceptability) than other types of sensors used for health status monitoring. This systematic review aims to synthesize research studies using smart wrist devices for a specific class of movement disorders. Following PRISMA-S guidelines, 130 studies were selected and analyzed. For each selected study, information is provided relating to the smartwatch/wristband/bracelet model used (whether it is commercial or not), the number of end-users involved in the experimentation stage, and finally the characteristics of the benchmark dataset possibly used for testing. Moreover, some articles also reported the type of raw data extracted from the smart wrist device, the implemented designed algorithmic pipeline, and the data classification methodology. It turned out that most of the studies have been published in the last ten years, showing a growing interest in the scientific community. The selected articles mainly investigate the relationship between smart wrist devices and Parkinson’s disease. Epilepsy and seizure detection are also research topics of interest, while there are few papers analyzing gait disorders, Huntington’s Disease, ataxia, or Tourette Syndrome.

Biological age estimation through DNA methylation (DNAm), i.e . the epigenetic clocks, is emerging as a possible tool to improve risk stratification for multiple outcomes. However, whether these tools predict mortality independently of canonical risk factors in subjects with T2D is unknown. Methods Among a cohort of 568 T2D patients followed for 16.8 years, we selected a subgroup of 50 subjects, 27 survived and 23 deceased at present, passing the quality check and balanced for all risk factors after propensity score matching. We analyzed DNAm from peripheral blood leukocytes using the Infinium Human MethylationEPIC BeadChip (Illumina) to evaluate biological aging through previously validated epigenetic clocks and assess the DNAm-estimated levels of selected inflammatory proteins and blood cell counts. We tested the associations of these estimates with mortality using two-stage residual-outcome regression analysis, creating a reference model on data from the group of survived patients. Results Deceased subjects had higher median epigenetic age expressed with DNAmPhenoAge algorithm (57.49 [54.72; 60.58] years. vs. 53.40 [49.73; 56.75] years; p = 0.012), and accelerated DunedinPoAm pace of aging (1.05 [1.02; 1.11] vs. 1.02 [0.98; 1.06]; p = 0.012). DNAm PhenoAge (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.05–1.28; p = 0.004) and DunedinPoAm (HR 3.65, 95% CI 1.43–9.35; p = 0.007) showed an association with mortality independently of canonical risk factors. The epigenetic predictors of 3 chronic inflammation-related proteins, i.e . CXCL10, CXCL11 and enRAGE, C-reactive protein methylation risk score and DNAm-based estimates of exhausted CD8 + T cell counts were higher in deceased subjects when compared to survived. Conclusions These findings suggest that biological aging, as estimated through existing epigenetic tools, is associated with mortality risk in individuals with T2D, independently of common risk factors and that increased DNAm-surrogates of inflammatory protein levels characterize deceased T2D patients. Replication in larger cohorts is needed to assess the potential of this approach to refine mortality risk in T2D.",Fabiola Olivieri,LVRFBL68R52D007H

Due to the widespread use of these devices, the system as a whole is extremely accepted, easy to use, requires no tuning of any kind, and guarantees extended functioning for a long period. From a technical standpoint, falls are identified using AI techniques to analyze 3D raw data acquired by the smartwatch’s built-in accelerometer. However, existing AI models for fall detection are often trained on simulated falls involving young people, which may not accurately represent the falls of elderly in unhealthy conditions, such as arthritis or Parkinson’s disease, leading to limitations in detecting falls in this population. Additionally, variations in hardware features among different smartwatches can result in inconsistencies in accelerometer data measurements across X, Y, and Z orientations, further complicating accurate fall detection. To address the challenge of limited and device-specific datasets and to enhance model generalization across various devices, a Deep Transfer Learning approach is proposed. This method proves effective when data are poor. Specifically, the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is applied to raw accelerometer signals to convert them into 2D images, enabling the use of deep architectures for Transfer Learning. By employing CWT on 5 s time windowed raw accelerometer signals, heat maps (scalograms) are generated. Real-time accelerations sampled at 50 Hz are collected using a smartwatch application, transmitted via Bluetooth to a smartphone app, and converted into scalograms. These serve as input for pre-trained Deep Learning models to estimate fall probabilities. Preliminary tests on the Wrist Early Daily Activity and Fall Dataset (WEDA-FALL) show promising results with an accuracy of approximately 98%, underscoring the efficacy of utilizing wrist-worn wearable devices for processing raw accelerometer data.",Andrea MANNI,MNNNDR75L21B936A

Autophagy plays essential roles in the regulation of muscle mass, function and integrity. However, the molecular machinery that regulates autophagy is still incompletely understood. In our recent study, we identified and characterized a novel Forkhead Box O (FoxO)-dependent gene, PHAF1/MYTHO (phagophore assembly factor 1/macro-autophagy and youth optimizer), as a novel autophagy regulator that controls muscle integrity. MYTHO/PHAF1 is upregulated in multiple conditions leading to muscle atrophy, and downregulation of its expression spares muscle atrophy triggered by fasting, denervation, cachexia and sepsis. Overexpression of PHAF1/MYTHO is sufficient to induce muscle atrophy. Prolonged downregulation of PHAF1/MYTHO causes a severe myopathic phenotype, which is characterized by impaired autophagy, muscle weakness, myofiber degeneration, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) hyperactivation and extensive ultrastructural defects, such as accumulation of proteinaceous and membranous structures and tubular aggregates.

To do so, mice carrying heterozygous deletion of the gene coding for contactin-associated protein-like 2 ( Cntnap2 +/- ) and their wild-type (WT) littermates were raised with limited bedding and nesting (LBN) and compared to both WT and Cntnap2 +/- mice raised in standard conditions, mapping their spontaneous behavior during freely-moving exploration. Results: Our data show no differences in locomotor activity or anxiety indicators across the four groups. By contrast, automated segmentation of the body-language revealed a significant impact of both genotype and early-life experience in shaping the spontaneous behavioral program. Thus, using unsupervised clustering, we unveiled two alternative behavioral profiles within our dataset. We found that one of the identified profiles largely overlapped with Cntnap2 +/- mice raised with LBN, while the other was equally shared among controls. Conclusions: We conclude that the coincidence of early-life adversity and Cntnap2 haploinsufficiency drastically alters behavioral structure in rodents.",Alessandro  Sale,SLALSN77L19F979I

The use of preclinical models can provide invaluable insight into how a negative environmental push interplays with genetic make-up in shaping psychiatric vulnerability. However, the assessment of psychiatric traits in cross-species studies often relies on the use of surrogate metrics as a proxy for the internal state, limiting the interpretation to context-dependent outcomes. In this work, we exploited a validated computational tool for digitalized ethological screening to identify spontaneous hallmarks of altered behavioral functioning in a dual-hit mouse model of psychiatric vulnerability. To do so, mice carrying heterozygous deletion of the gene coding for Contactin-associated protein-like 2 ( Cntnap2 +/- ) and their wild-type (WT) littermates were raised with limited bedding and nesting (LBN). These animals were compared to both WT and Cntnap2 +/- mice raised in standard conditions, mapping their spontaneous behavior during freely-moving exploration. Our data show that descriptors of motility state or surrogate anxiety indicators largely failed in detecting subtle diversion from control conditions. By contrast, automated segmentation of the body-language revealed a significant impact of both genotype and early-life experience in shaping the spontaneous behavioral programming. Thus, using unsupervised clustering, we unveiled two alternative neurobehavioral profiles within our dataset. We found that one of the identified profiles largely overlapped with Cntnap2 +/- mice raised with LBN, while the other was equally shared among controls. We conclude that the coincidence of early-life adversity and Cntnap2 haploinsufficiency drastically reshapes behavioral structure in rodents. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Enhancing the predictive and face validity of preclinical models in psychiatric research remains a significant challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity and complexity of these conditions. While animal models are crucial for understanding the risk factors involved, replicating the full complexity of these conditions continues to pose difficulties. In this study, we use a tool for digitalized behavioral screening to investigate emotional hallmarks in a double-hit (environmental and genetic) mouse model of vulnerability for psychiatric disorder, glimpsing subliminal behavioral disturbances not captured with traditional assessments. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of novel computational tools in identifying subtle behavioral deviations and support the hypothesis that gene-environment interaction contributes to shape alternative behavioral structure in mice.",Alessandro  Sale,SLALSN77L19F979I

Currently, the role of oral health in relation to IC remains underexplored. Objectives To examine the associations among the number of remaining teeth and IC domains. Methods From the 30 468 subjects of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009–2014, we included 787 participants aged ≥ 60 years with available dental/IC‐related data, representing a weighted population of approximately 8.35 million U.S. older adults. Dentition status was categorised into four groups: ≥ 20 teeth, 10–19 teeth, 1–9 teeth and edentulous. IC domains (locomotion, vitality, psychological well‐being, sensory function and cognition) were operationalised using NHANES items aligned with WHO definitions. Results Compared with participants with ≥ 20 teeth, those with 10–19 teeth had significantly higher odds of locomotion difficulty [adjusted‐odds ratio (OR): 2.18; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.30–3.66], participants with 1–9 teeth/edentulous also showed an increased risk of locomotion difficulty. The number of remaining teeth was also associated with reduced vitality, particularly unintentional weight loss and lower appetite. Edentulous participants had an increased risk of poor psychological well‐being, including depressive symptoms (adjusted‐OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.22–3.01) and anhedonia (adjusted‐OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.22–4.24). Significant associations were also found between edentulism and sensory impairments, particularly hearing loss (adjusted‐OR: 2.42; 95% CI: 1.17–4.99). Conclusion The number of remaining teeth in older adults was significantly associated with impairments across multiple IC domains. In particular, reduced dentition (10–19 teeth, 1–9 teeth or edentulism) was consistently linked to impaired locomotion.",VITTORIO DIBELLO,DBLVTR77T16F376W

Based on the PRISMA guidelines and preregistering in PROSPERO (CRD42022366520), we searched the Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases. Out of 2,675 articles, 27 met the inclusion criteria. The synthesized findings on cognition (23 studies) revealed an uncertain influence of music type and presentation modalities on memory outcomes. In contrast, happy-sounding music seems to support executive functioning (2 out of 4) and processing speed (1), when presented in the background, and facilitate language processes (2 out of 3), when given prior to the task. However, the high heterogeneity and inconsistency in the music type and presentation modalities, as well as in the cognitive outcomes considered, prevented us from drawing clear conclusions on the effect of music listening on older adults’ cognition. For affective outcomes, a narrative synthesis of the findings on mood (12 studies) and arousal (7 studies) outcomes showed that, regardless of music presentation modality, happy- and sad-sounding music increase or decrease mood/valence and arousal, respectively. Results from meta-analysis showed no significant cognitive benefits from music listening (SMD = 0.09, [95% CI: −0.17, 0.35], p = 0.51) and suggest a positive effect of happy-sounding music on arousal (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.74], p = 0.005), but not on valence (SMD = 0.79 [95% CI: −0.25, 1.84], p = 0.14). The methodological shortcomings of the extant literature call upon the need for further studies adopting more rigorous and consistent approaches that better elucidate the potential benefits of music listening on cognitive and affective outcomes among older adults.",Sella  Enrico,SLLNRC89E23F979U

Architects have the responsibility to promote inclusion through equal accessibility of healthcare facilities for all people, regardless of age, gender, origin, social, economic and cultural background, physical and mental conditions, and any conditions of fragility (e.g., children or adolescents, women, the elderly, mental health, sensory disorders, end of life, etc.). What does it mean to design for health and to design for inclusion in healthcare environments? Starting from the studies which showed the influence of the environment on health, this volume intends to highlight the role of the sensory and perceptual qualities of the environment to transform people's experience of care and promote well-being and inclusion in the social and healthy community. Sensory design is based on the primary senses and how they affect the perception, the relationship and interaction between humans and the environment. Everything we feel, perceive, understand and learn comes to us through our senses, which are the basis of psycho-social and environmental well-being. Considering the different ways in which each of us perceives things, sensory perception is also at the root of all the diversity that makes up the broad spectrum of the human population. In this volume, I have therefore tried to explain what attention to sensory perception means to me in order to promote inclusion in healthcare settings, also providing an overview of the research I have undertaken over the years, a research journey which has given me the opportunity to learn what it means to design for people who live in healthcare facilities, to investigate their specific needs, and to use co-design tools to involve them directly in the design process. The volume is divided into three main sections: theory, experience and practice. The first section aims at introducing the relationship between inclusive design and sensory design in the healthcare environments and deals with the theories, approaches and design strategies that enable and promote inclusion from the point of view of perception, psychological comfort and interactions with the environment. Therefore, inclusion is not only promoted through functionality, urban and regional location of facilities and the layout of their spaces, but also by paying attention to the different ways of “perceiving” and “feeling” spaces. This approach to design has been developed in different areas of intervention: the integration of art and nature in the architecture to promote restoration by senses; the role of perception in spatial orientation strategies to self-determine people by considering all their different sensory needs; the design of the soundscape to promote comfort; the necessity of a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach, involving people who live in the healthcare spaces, to improve knowledge into the design process. The second section collects, analyses and describes some best practices of healthcare spaces, chosen from among those created in Europe over the last twenty years, which present innovative solutions in the field of inclusion in terms of sensory design, seeking to capture different examples in relation to their location and culture, the type of building, the users they are aimed at and the particular features of the solutions proposed. This chapter is intended to be a personal journey through beautiful and inclusive healthcare buildings, starting from studying, reading scientific papers, books or articles on the web, going on by travelling and visiting different buildings, and meeting architects and designers who conceived the projects. The focus was not on “special” solutions, but on inclusive places that took fragility into account, proposing different scenarios based on multisensory experiences. Projects were analysed on different scales, from “creating an atmosphere” to transforming a space or room, designing a department, or even an entire building: Sight & Sound Centre, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London, UK; Helsinki Children's Hospital, Finland; SJD Cancer Center, Barcelona, Spain; Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen (SDCC), Denmark; Nordjyske stemninger (Moods of Northern Jutland), Sensory Delivery Room, North Jutland Regional Hospital in Hjørring (RHN), Denmark; Inclusive architecture for childbirth: Natural Birth Unit, Hospital Universitario HM Nuevo Belén, Madrid, Spain; Two Swedish models of local healthcare facilities to include citizens: Lindesberg Health Center and Angereds Närsjukhus, Sweden; REHAB, Clinic for Neurorehabilitation and Paraplegiology, Basel, Switzerland. Finally, the third section presents an interior design experience that I conducted at the Salus Pueri Children’s Hospital in Padua, aimed at creating an inclusive environment using solutions that take into account the sensory perception of young patients and their families. The Salus Pueri - Crescere La Vita Foundation has committed a Project of Humanisation of the Children's Hospital to DU IT s.r.l., with the collaboration of prof.ssa Maria Chiara Torricelli and prof. Paolo Felli. The project has developed design solutions compatible with the architectural-executive project under construction to allow the future hospital to satisfy psychological, inclusive and social needs of users. The Project of Humanisation was developed collaboratively, with the involvement of all stakeholders in a multidisciplinary working group, starting in May 2023 and beginning the construction in 2025. The aim of the project was to structure an inclusive path for patients arriving at the hospital and their families, involving everyone in a journey of discovery and sensory exploration, where they can positively distract themselves and continue their lives, by playing and learning together.",Elena  Bellini,BLLLNE87B46A564T

In Italy, the role of the Family and Community Nurse (FCN) was introduced as a response to these demographic changes, aimed at ensuring personalized and integrated care for the older adults at the national level. Despite national institutional recognition, the implementation of the FCN role varies considerably across regions, resulting in uneven and fragmented service delivery. To better understand this variability, the present study aimed to describe the perceived barriers and facilitators influencing the delivery of community-based care to older adults. Methods A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, from December 2023 to May 2024, using semi-structured interviews on a purposive sample. Forty-one FCNs from four Italian regions were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Qualitative Content Analysis, supported by NVivo software. Results Under the overarching theme reflecting the barriers and facilitators that influence the delivery of family and community nursing care to older adults, six sub-themes and thirteen categories were identified. The key barriers were the misalignment between strategic leadership level and managerial and operational levels, shortages of instrumental and human resources, heterogeneity and fragmentation of nursing documentation, lack of uniformity of the training pathways and, limited recognition of the FCN role. The most frequent facilitators were current regulations and national policies, the support and collaboration of local organizations and local political institutions, as well as the expansion of interprofessional collaborations. Conclusions The study emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to strengthen the governance of the FCN role, ensuring greater integration between policy directives, resources, training, and organizational practice. This requires coordinated efforts among health care institutions, universities, and professional organizations to create a system that not only adequately trains FCNs but also ensures their functional and effective placement within community-based care.

In the Italian context that we consider, women can anticipate retirement after age 57, if they have obtained 35 years of contributions. By using Italian administrative data, the analysis employs a novel identification strategy based on a Differences-in-Differences design, in which assignment to treatment is estimated in a Regression Discontinuity setting. By comparing women who are eligible for the early retirement scheme before and after the reform, we find that those eligible retire earlier by about 2 months after the reform is implemented. We also f ind that women eligible for the early retirement scheme after the reform implementation receive a 900 Euros lower annuity compared to those not affected by the reform. This effect corresponds to a 5% lifetime reduction in annuity. The effects are stronger for women with low labor market attachment and without a college education.",YLENIA BRILLI,BRLYLN83E42F656M

A newly characterized variant, semantic behavioral variant FTD (sbvFTD), exhibits predominant right temporal atrophy with features bridging behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). This study investigates the longitudinal structural MRI correlates of these FTD variants, focusing on cortical and subcortical structural damage to aid differential diagnosis and prognosis. Methods Seventy‐one FTD patients (bvFTD = 45, sbvFTD = 11, svPPA = 15) and 37 healthy controls participated in a prospective study involving up to 24 months of serial neurological, neuropsychological, and 3 T MRI assessments. Cortical thickness and subcortical/cerebellar volumes were analyzed with linear mixed‐effect models. Support vector machine (SVM) models were used to classify subjects using baseline and longitudinal patterns of structural damage. Results At baseline, sbvFTD showed right‐predominant temporal pole involvement associated with significant right frontal atrophy. Longitudinally, bvFTD showed widespread bilateral cortical and basal ganglia damage, svPPA demonstrated steady temporal lobe progression, and sbvFTD progressed primarily in left temporal and frontal regions with limited right hemisphere involvement. Baseline cortical thickness of frontal regions predicted subsequent functional decline in bvFTD and sbvFTD. A multiclass SVM model provided a good diagnostic classification accuracy, with similar results when using baseline data only (82%) and adding longitudinal data (83%). Conclusions This study delineates the unique structural MRI features and progression of FTD variants, highlighting sbvFTD as a distinct entity with early extra‐temporal involvement. These findings support the development of diagnostic and prognostic tools leveraging neuroimaging biomarkers.",Edoardo Gioele Spinelli,SPNDDG87T19F205S

Linear regression models were used. Results: After having adjusted for age, sex, education, marital status, and working status, higher AARC-Gains, lower AARC-Losses, more positive ERA, and fewer non-communicable diseases were cross-sectionally associated with greater likelihood of engagement with vigorous physical activity (Adjusted models Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.08; 0.86; and 1.06, respectively).

The interaction between ERA (i.e., General Views on Aging) and number of non-communicable diseases was a statistically significant cross-sectional predictor of likelihood of engagement with vigorous physical activity (OR = 0.99; p = 0.044). Conclusions: Having more positive and less negative views on aging may prompt vigorous physical activity engagement. Moreover, positive general views of aging may be particularly important for physical activity among those who have one or more non-communicable diseases. Although we cannot infer causality, promoting positive views on aging and decreasing negative views on aging could help fostering active aging, especially among those with physical health conditions.",DANIELA LEMMO,LMMDNL87R58F839S

La precocità della cronicità influisce sulla funzionalità individuale, sui livelli di benessere e di qualità di vita, sull'uso dell'assistenza sanitaria e sul rischio di mortalità. In un'ottica di healthy aging, la motivazione all'assunzione e al cambiamento dei comportamenti di salute appare determinante per il mantenimento di buone pratiche, per un migliore engagement sanitario e per migliori esiti di salute. Sebbene la ricerca abbia sostenuto la relazione tra cura di sé e promozione della salute, le concettualizzazioni del self-care rimangono piuttosto contrastanti e non sempre risultano connesse alla motivazione. Nell'ambito di un più ampio progetto psicologico clinico, scopo del presente lavoro è identificare i modi in cui vengono declinati i costrutti di motivazione e di self-care nell'ambito dell'invecchiamento. Secondo le linee guida PRISMA è stata effettuata una systematic review utilizzando i database MEDLINE/PubMed e PsycINFO. 31 articoli hanno soddisfatto i criteri di inclusione. Sono state identificate 3 traiettorie principali: la motivazione come processo nell'invecchiamento salutare; il self-care come capacità di salute e di autonomia; la ricorsività tra motivazione e self-care nella malattia cronica. Dai risultati emerge la necessità di nuovi sforzi di ricerca per declinare concettualmente i rapporti tra i due costrutti nell'ambito dell'healthy aging, al fine di promuovere interventi motivazionali di self-care nel processo dell'invecchiamento.",DANIELA LEMMO,LMMDNL87R58F839S

The novelty consists in the fact that we use the parameters characterizing the CIR process itself (long-term mean and volatility), in their intrinsic meanings, as quantitative measures of the long-term fitting attitude of the Lee–Carter model and synthetic indicators of the overall risk of this model. The analysis encompasses 25 European countries, to provide evidence-based indications about the goodness of fit of the Lee–Carter model in describing the GGR evolution. We highlight some stylized facts, namely systematic evidence about the fitting bias and the risk of the model across ages and countries. Furthermore, we perform a functional cluster analysis, allowing to capture similarities in the fitting performance of the Lee–Carter model among countries.",Emilia Di Lorenzo,DLRMLE61B54F839U

To what extent are these provisions holding back female labor supply? We estimate a rich life cycle model of labor supply and savings for couples and singles using the method of simulated moments (MSM) on the 1945 and 1955 birth-year cohorts and use it to evaluate what would happen without these provisions. Our model matches well the life cycle profiles of labor market participation, hours, and savings for married and single people and generates plausible elasticities of labor supply. Eliminating marriage-related provisions drastically increases the participation of married women over their entire life cycle, reduces the participation of married men after age 60, and increases the savings of couples in both cohorts, including the later one, which has similar participation to that of more recent generations. If the resulting government surplus were used to lower income taxation, there would be large welfare gains for the vast majority of the population.

The aim of this study is to describe disability trends in European countries, focusing on age, period and cohort effects. We used data from the Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE). The data were pooled from waves 1 to 9 (excluding wave 3) and we considered only Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland, resulting in a sample of 72188 respondents and 234946 rows. The response variables were the global index of activity limitation (GALI), the number of limitations in instrumental (IADL) and non-instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). All three variables were dichotomized. A logistic age-period-cohort interaction model was used to estimate the prevalence for each of the three responses. Cohort effects were estimated as the interaction between age and period. The model was estimated using generalized estimating equation with an unstructured working correlation matrix. Gender and individual country-specific wealth quintile were included as covariates. We found that disability prevalence was lower in men than in women and exhibited a non-linear relationship with age. Additionally, prevalence increased over time, peaking in wave 7 (pre-Covid-19) for GALI only, and decreased with higher wealth quintiles. Country-specific differences were also observed. The cohort effect mitigated the impact of age, except in older cohorts for GALI and IADL.",Rossella  Miglio,MGLRSL65H56H501P

The aim of the MeaTIc study was to determine the impact of three diets associated with different risks of CRC (a meat diet (MBD: high risk), a meat diet with alpha-tocopherol supplementation (MBD-T: medium risk), and a pesco-vegetarian diet (PVD: low risk)) on CRC risk markers and fecal microbiota. Methods: A controlled, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, 12-week dietary intervention was conducted on 113 participants aged 18–50 years. The primary outcome was a change in fecal water (FW) genotoxicity. Secondary outcomes were changes in FW cytotoxicity, bile acids, fecal microbiota, and metabolomic profiles. Results: A total of 103 participants (91%) completed the study. After adjustment for possible confounding factors, a significant increase (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in FW genotoxicity (+43%) was observed only in the MBD group. Regarding FW cytotoxicity, a decrease in cell viability (−7%, <i>p</i> = 0.054) was observed after MBD, while no changes occurred for the other diets. Bile acid analysis showed an increase in total bile acids during MBD-T (+35%) and a decrease during PVD (−2.3%). Upon correlating changes in bile acids with FW genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, a moderate correlation (R = 0.66; <i>p</i> < 0.0001) emerged between changes in total bile acids and changes in FW cytotoxicity. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of changes in the gut microbiota revealed no clustering by diet, while metabolomic analysis showed a clear clustering of changes in metabolites. A random forest regression model identified 2-hydroxybutyric acid and cholic acids among the metabolites most correlated with FW genotoxicity (R^2 = 0.84 for the model). Conclusion: These results indicate that MBD can lead to a worsening of CRC markers in a relatively short time. Our findings also suggest that intervention diets had a greater impact on the metabolism of the gut microbiota, and thus, its metabolites, than on its taxonomic composition. A correlation between some metabolites and FW genotoxicity was also found.",Sara Ristori,RSTSRA92D51A851V

The model features partially informed private agents who receive a noisy signal about economic fundamentals from a fully informed public sector. When monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is unique and determinate. However, the release of news about current or future fundamentals can still generate a form of ""Paradox of Transparency"" through general equilibrium interactions between aggregate demand and monetary policy. When the Taylor principle is violated, belief-driven equilibria may emerge. Validation exercises based on the Simulated Method of Moments confirm the empirical plausibility of the model's key implications.",Luisa  Errichiello,RRCLSU81H54F839Q

More specifically, the assay detects DNA migration from agarose gel-embedded nucleoids, which depends on assay conditions and the level of DNA damage. Certain steps in the comet assay procedure have substantial impact on the magnitude of DNA migration (e.g. electric potential and time of electrophoresis). Inter-laboratory variation in DNA migration levels occurs because there is no agreement on optimal assay conditions or suitable assay controls. The purpose of the hCOMET ring trial was to test potassium bromate (KBrO3) as a positive control for the formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg)-modified comet assay. To this end, participating laboratories used semi-standardized protocols for cell culture (i.e. cell culture, KBrO3 exposure, and cryopreservation of cells) and comet assay procedures, whereas the data acquisition was not standardized (i.e. staining of comets and image analysis). Segregation of the total variation into partial standard deviation (SD) in % Tail DNA units indicates the importance of cell culture procedures (SD = 10.9), comet assay procedures (SD = 12.3), staining (SD = 7.9) and image analysis (SD = 0.5) on the overall inter-laboratory variation of DNA migration (SD = 18.2). Future studies should assess sources of variation in each of these steps. On the positive side, the hCOMET ring trial demonstrates that KBrO3 is a robust positive control for the Fpg-modified comet assay. In conclusion, the hCOMET ring trial has demonstrated a high reproducibility of detecting genotoxic effects by the comet assay, but inter-laboratory variation of DNA migration levels is a concern.",Sara Ristori,RSTSRA92D51A851V

However, there has not been a recommended long-term positive control for this version of the comet assay. We have investigated potassium bromate as a positive control for the Fpg-modified comet assay because it generates many Fpg-sensitive sites with a little concurrent generation of DNA strand breaks. Eight laboratories used the same procedure for the treatment of monocytic THP-1 cells with potassium bromate (0, 0.5, 1.5, and 4.5 mM) and subsequent cryopreservation in a freezing medium consisting of 50% foetal bovine serum, 40% RPMI-1640 medium, and 10% dimethyl sulphoxide. The samples were analysed by the Fpg-modified comet assay three times over a 3-year period. All laboratories obtained a positive concentration–response relationship in cryopreserved samples (linear regression coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.99). However, there was a wide difference in the levels of Fpg-sensitive sites between the laboratory with the lowest (4.2% Tail DNA) and highest (74% Tail DNA) values in THP-1 cells after exposure to 4.5 mM KBrO3. In an attempt to assess sources of inter-laboratory variation in Fpg-sensitive sites, comet images from one experiment in each laboratory were forwarded to a central laboratory for visual scoring. There was high consistency between measurements of %Tail DNA values in each laboratory and the visual score of the same comets done in the central laboratory (r = 0.98, P &lt; 0.001, linear regression).

Rather than processing blood samples directly, it can be desirable to cryopreserve whole blood or isolated cells for later analysis by the comet assay. However, this creates concern about artificial accumulation of DNA damage during cryopreservation. In this study, 10 laboratories used standardized cryopreservation and thawing procedures of monocytic (THP-1) or lymphocytic (TK6) cells. Samples were cryopreserved in small aliquots in 50% foetal bovine serum, 40% cell culture medium, and 10% dimethyl sulphoxide. Subsequently, cryopreserved samples were analysed by the standard comet assay on three occasions over a 3-year period. Levels of DNA strand breaks in THP-1 cells were increased (four laboratories), unaltered (four laboratories), or decreased (two laboratories) by long-term storage. Pooled analysis indicates only a modest positive association between storage time and levels of DNA strand breaks in THP-1 cells (0.37% Tail DNA per year, 95% confidence interval: −0.05, 0.78). In contrast, DNA strand break levels were not increased by cryopreservation in TK6 cells. There was inter-laboratory variation in levels of DNA strand breaks in THP-1 cells (SD = 3.7% Tail DNA) and TK6 reference sample cells (SD = 9.4% Tail DNA), whereas the intra-laboratory residual variation was substantially smaller (i.e. SD = 0.4%–2.2% Tail DNA in laboratories with the smallest and largest variation).

ROS/RNS involved in cardiac redox-signaling originate from diverse sources, and their levels are tightly controlled by key endogenous antioxidant systems that counteract their accumulation. However, dysregulated redox-stress resulting from inefficient removal of ROS/RNS leads to inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death, contributing to the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent Advances: Basic and clinical studies demonstrate the critical role of selenium (Se) and selenoproteins (unique proteins that incorporate Se into their active site in the form of the 21st proteinogenic amino acid selenocysteine [Sec]), including glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, in cardiovascular redox homeostasis, representing a first-line enzymatic antioxidant defense of the heart. Increasing attention has been paid to emerging selenoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (i.e., a multifunctional intracellular organelle whose disruption triggers cardiac inflammation and oxidative stress, leading to multiple CVD), which are crucially involved in redox balance, antioxidant activity, and calcium and ER homeostasis. Critical Issues: This review focuses on endogenous antioxidant strategies with therapeutic potential, particularly selenoproteins, which are very promising but deserve more detailed and clinical studies. Future Directions: The importance of selective selenoproteins in embryonic development and the consequences of their mutations and inborn errors highlight the need to improve knowledge of their biological function in myocardial redox signaling. This could facilitate the development of personalized approaches for the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CVD.",Tommaso  Angelone,NGLTMS76L09H490D

Despite progress in HA research, no consensus exists on its constitutive elements, and current frameworks often do not capture its full complexity. Building on the World Health Organization (WHO) HA definition, we organise empirical evidence under three dimensions: intrinsic capacity (IC), functional ability (FA) and the environment (ENV). To identify conceptual, empirical and methodological gaps, we provide a structured synthesis of concepts, measures and instruments used in HA research, evaluating methodological advancement and standardisation in HA measurement. Following PRISMA guidelines, we extract data from 55 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies with a multidimensional HA focus. We arrange evidence into three primary domains (IC, FA and ENV; first order), 15 sub-domains (second order) and 84 themes (third order). We identify operational categories via thematic analysis and inductively determine the final categorisation, moving from third to first order based on conceptual and measurement considerations. Given the lack of systematic knowledge on ENV, we generate a more nuanced categorisation capturing different levels of analysis and contexts. We compute a mean usage ratio to assess differences in the application of validated tools across HA aspects. The review revealed substantial variability in HA conceptualisation and measurement. IC and FA are the most extensively studied domains, with well-established measurement approaches and widespread use. Common themes include locomotion, cognitive capacities and functional status. ENV remains significantly underexplored and lacks standardised measurement, as mainstream assessments still prioritise deficit-based approaches over enabling environments. This analysis calls for a standardised, multidimensional HA model integrating individual and contextual factors, recognising the role of structural environmental supports in shaping ageing trajectories. Future research should prioritise comprehensive HA measurement and pursue an interdisciplinary approach bridging conceptual and methodological gaps to inform HA policies effectively.",Aleksandra Torbica,TRBLSN75R42Z118V

The perception of softness plays a key role in interactions with various objects, both in the real world and in virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems. The latter can be enriched with haptic feedback on virtual objects’ softness to improve immersivity and realism. In such systems, visual expectation can influence tactile sensitivity to softness, as multisensory integration attempts to create a coherent perceptual experience. Nevertheless, expectation is sometimes reported to attenuate, and other times to enhance, perception. Elucidating how the perception of softness is affected by visual expectation in VR/AR is relevant not only to the neuropsychology and neuroscience of perception, but also to practical applications, such as VR/AR-based training or rehabilitation. Approach. Here, by using novel wearable tactile displays of softness previously described by us, we investigated how the sensitivity to softness in a visuo–tactile VR platform can be influenced by expectation. Twelve subjects were engaged in comparing the softness of pairs of virtual objects, familiar or not, with tactile feedback of softness and visual expectation either conflicting or not. The objects’ Young’s moduli were initially randomly selected from a large set, spanning two orders of magnitude (0.5, 2, 20, 50 and 100 MPa), and then their difference was iteratively reduced, to reach the just noticeable difference in softness. Main results. For the intermediate modulus, a conflict between tactile feedback and visual expectation caused a statistically significant increase in sensitivity. Significance. This finding supports the theory that there can be conditions in which contradictory stimuli strengthen attention (to resolve conflicting sensory information), which in turn can reverse the sensory silencing effect that expectation may otherwise have on perception.",Federico Carpi,CRPFRC75B10G702O

In Italy, the role of the Family and Community Nurse (FCN) was introduced as a response to these demographic changes, aimed at ensuring personalized and integrated care for the older adults at the national level. Despite national institutional recognition, the implementation of the FCN role varies considerably across regions, resulting in uneven and fragmented service delivery. To better understand this variability, the present study aimed to describe the perceived barriers and facilitators influencing the delivery of community-based care to older adults. Methods A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, from December 2023 to May 2024, using semi-structured interviews on a purposive sample. Forty-one FCNs from four Italian regions were interviewed. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Qualitative Content Analysis, supported by NVivo software. Results Under the overarching theme reflecting the barriers and facilitators that influence the delivery of family and community nursing care to older adults, six sub-themes and thirteen categories were identified. The key barriers were the misalignment between strategic leadership level and managerial and operational levels, shortages of instrumental and human resources, heterogeneity and fragmentation of nursing documentation, lack of uniformity of the training pathways and, limited recognition of the FCN role. The most frequent facilitators were current regulations and national policies, the support and collaboration of local organizations and local political institutions, as well as the expansion of interprofessional collaborations. Conclusions The study emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to strengthen the governance of the FCN role, ensuring greater integration between policy directives, resources, training, and organizational practice. This requires coordinated efforts among health care institutions, universities, and professional organizations to create a system that not only adequately trains FCNs but also ensures their functional and effective placement within community-based care.

The introduction of the FCN has been inconsistent across the nation, leading to fragmented experiences and challenges in fully integrating the role into the healthcare system. Based on Cohen’s hermeneutic approach, this phenomenological study explores the lived experiences and meaning of being an FCN in Italy. Semi-structured interviews were conducted from December 2023 to June 2024. Interviews were transcribed, read in-depth and analyzed. Thirty-seven FCNs from four Italian regions were interviewed. Four main themes were identified: (a) Navigating elderly care complexity; (b) Education as a core function; (c) Being a node in the healthcare network; (d) Establishing the FCN identity through role differentiation. Being a FCN means managing complex needs, ensuring continuity of care, and collaborating effectively with the other primary care providers. FCNs distinguish themselves from task-oriented home care nurses by embracing a proactive approach, gaining greater organizational autonomy and actively shaping their professional identity. The implications for practice suggest the need to support FCNs in this consolidation phase through health policies that enhance their contribution to community care.",Isabella Santomauro,SNTSLL96A61L219O

Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) can provide insights into psychological, psychosocial, and quality-of-life (QoL) dimensions, yet their use—particularly among older adults—remains inconsistent. This AI-assisted rapid review aimed to map how PROMs are currently applied in adults with T2DM, with specific attention to studies involving older populations, focusing on their role in assessing well-being, distress, depression, and treatment satisfaction, as well as their implementation in clinical and organizational practice. Methods: A rapid review was conducted using Elicit, an AI tool designed to support systematic evidence synthesis. Studies published between 2015 and 2025 were identified from Semantic Scholar, complemented by manual searches for recent or unindexed papers. Eligibility criteria required inclusion of adults with T2DM and use of validated PROMs in real-world settings. Studies explicitly describing older or elderly subgroups were highlighted separately. After screening 504 records, 167 studies were included. Data extraction covered study design, instruments used, populations, outcomes, and implementation details. Results: The most frequently assessed outcomes were diabetes distress, depression, QoL, treatment satisfaction, and self-efficacy. Common instruments included PAID, DDS, PHQ-9, WHO-5, EQ-5D, SF-36, DTSQ, and GDS. Evidence showed PROMs effectively identified high-risk patients and informed tailored interventions, but integration into routine care remained limited. Barriers included workflow disruption, lack of provider training, heterogeneity of tools, and insufficient cultural validation. Facilitators included brief instruments, digital administration, and linkage with care planning. Conclusions: PROMs are valuable in capturing psychosocial and psychological burdens in adults with T2DM, including but not limited to older populations, but routine implementation is inconsistent. Broader adoption will require digital infrastructure, clinician training, and organizational integration, as well as the development of PROMs that capture experiences with emerging diabetes technologies. Methodologically, this study illustrates the feasibility of AI-assisted rapid reviews to generate timely, evidence-informed syntheses.",Jacopo Lenzi,LNZJCP85T31A944O

This study examines the influence of depression on compliance with recommended annual diabetes assessments in patients within the Local Healthcare Authority of Romagna. From a clinical health psychology perspective, understanding how depression influences patients’ engagement in managing their conditions is crucial. This insight can help improve healthcare services by ensuring they address mental health needs and thereby enhance treatment effectiveness and overall patient outcomes. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included residents of Romagna with incident T2DM from 2015 to 2017, followed from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022. Depression was identified via hospital discharge records or antidepressant prescriptions. Adherence to diabetes care guidelines was measured using the Guideline Composite Indicator (GCI). Results: The study included 13,285 patients, with a mean age of 61.1 years. Prevalence of post-diabetes depression increased from 3.0% in 2018 to 8.9% in 2022. Initial analyses showed higher GCI rates among patients with depression. However, propensity-score adjustment revealed that by 2021–2022, patients with pre-diabetes depression had 5% lower compliance rates (p-value ≤ 0.05). Older adults with depression had reduced adherence, while younger adults with post-diabetes depression had higher adherence rates. Conclusions: Depression significantly affects adherence to diabetes care guidelines in T2DM patients, particularly among older adults. Integrated care models addressing both diabetes and depression are crucial for improving health outcomes.",Jacopo Lenzi,LNZJCP85T31A944O

While previous studies have shown that GelMA at a low concentration (5% w/v) allows for the growth of diverse cells, its 3D printability has been found to be limited by its low viscosity. To overcome that drawback, making the hydrogel both compatible with hiPSCs and 3D-printable, we developed an extrudable GelMA-based bioink by adding xanthan gum (XG). The GelMA-XG composite hydrogel had an elastic modulus (~9 kPa) comparable to that of cardiac tissue, and enabled 3D printing with high values of printing accuracy (83%) and printability (0.98). Tests with hiPSCs showed the hydrogel’s ability to promote their proliferation within both 2D and 3D cell cultures. The tests also showed that hiPSCs inside hemispheres of the hydrogel were able to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, capable of spontaneous contractions (average frequency of ~0.5 Hz and amplitude of ~2%). Furthermore, bioprinting tests proved the possibility of fabricating 3D constructs of the hiPSC-laden hydrogel, with well-defined line widths (~800 μm).",Federico Carpi,CRPFRC75B10G702O

In the present work, we integrated in vivo comparative metabolomics and lipidomics analyses of serum from WT and Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice with in vitro uptake measurements in HEK293 cells overexpressing OCT1 or OCT2, to identify and characterize novel endogenous substrates of OCT1/2. Among the significant metabolite changes, ethanolamine in the serum of Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was approximately 70% lower than in WT mice. The ethanolamine influx K<sub>t</sub> mediated by OCT1/2 ranged from 7.6 ± 3.7 mmol/L (mouse Oct2) to 13.4 ± 8.1 mmol/L (mouse Oct1). OCT1/2 did not transport ethanolamine at physiologically relevant extracellular concentrations (10-100 μmol/L), suggesting that OCTs do not play a role in the hepatic/renal uptake of ethanolamine. Conversely, the release of ethanolamine by cells pre-exposed to ethanolamine at the extracellular concentration of 50 μmol/l was significantly greater in the presence of OCTs. Finally, the serum of the Oct1/2<sup>-/-</sup> mice was characterized by a stark elevation across phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylethanolamine species, but not in phosphatidylcholine and diacylglycerol species.

Recently we demonstrated that parvovirus B19 (B19V) activates normal human dermal fibroblasts and induces expression of different profibrotic/pro-inflammatory genes. This observation prompted us to investigate whether it is also able to induce fibroblast senescence as a potential pathogenetic mechanism in B19V-induced fibrosis. Methods Primary cultures of fibroblasts were infected with B19V and analysed for the acquisition of senescence markers, such as morphological modifications, senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, DNA damage response and expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP)-related factors. Results We demonstrated that B19V-infected fibroblasts develop typical senescence features such as enlarged and flat-shaped morphology and SA-β-gal activity similar to that observed in SSc skin fibroblasts. They also developed an SASP-like phenotype characterized by mRNA expression and release of some pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB. Moreover, we observed B19V-induced DNA damage with the comet assay: a subpopulation of fibroblasts from B19V-infected cultures showed a significantly higher level of DNA strand breaks and oxidative damage compared with mock-infected cells. An increased level and nuclear localization of γH2AX, a hallmark of DNA damage response, were also found. Conclusions B19V-induced senescence and production of SASP-like factors in normal dermal fibroblasts could represent a new pathogenic mechanism of non-productive B19V infection, which may have a role in the fibrotic process.",Sara Ristori,RSTSRA92D51A851V

This essay explores the potential designation of older people as an independent category under the law, considering that linking changes in their socio-legal status solely to the passage of time has been viewed as a form of “subjective discrimination” by civil law scholars so far. While labor and social welfare laws have long recognized the “special status” of elderly individuals, and the EU has increasingly referred to them in recent consumer-focused legislation, the prevailing view in Italian civil doctrine opposes the creation of an “old subject” category, arguing that vulnerability cannot be considered an intrinsic and defining characteristic solely based on age. Notwithstanding that, the essay suggests that creating a group or category for vulnerable (elderly) individuals could have several advantages, including recognizing their rights, assigning obligations, implementing tailored procedures, and providing forms of protection.

However, despite technological advancements, the widespread adoption of these innovations remains limited. The paper explores the critical role of user engagement in the design and testing phases of healthcare technologies for older adults. A key barrier lies in the mismatch between technological solutions and the actual needs, preferences, and daily realities of older users. This issue is compounded by ageism, the digital divide, and stereotypical views of older adults as a homogeneous group with limited technological capabilities. Starting from the need to better understand the relation between older adults and technology considering attitude, digital literacy and technology use we analyse the possible strategies to enhance adoption rate. The often unjustified exclusion of older adults from clinical trials, particularly in the field of digital health, creates relevant risks to undermine the validity and equity of the proposed interventions. A wider inclusion in design and testing could bridge the gap between technological innovation and user needs, fostering greater acceptance and adoption of healthcare technologies that enhance autonomy and well-being among aging populations.",Lorena Rossi,RSSLRN63H67C770Z

Previous studies have reported the upregulation of diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) in AML. This study investigated the effects of ritanserin, a DGKα-specific inhibitor, and DGKζ-IN4 or BAY 2965501, DGKζ-selective inhibitors, on a panel of AML cell lines. Ritanserin induced apoptotic cell death across all tested models, whereas DGKζ inhibitors triggered both apoptosis and necrosis to variable extents, with HL-60 cells being the most responsive to both compounds. Drug sensitivity did not correlate with DGKα or DGKζ expression levels, indicating that additional factors may influence cellular susceptibility. THP-1 proteomic profiling revealed that ritanserin broadly downregulated proteins involved in antigen presentation, cell cycle and metabolism, while BAY 2965501 affected a smaller and distinct but functionally similar protein subset, implying different mechanisms of action. Gene silencing confirmed AML cell line-specific dependence on DGK isoforms: HEL cells were sensitive to DGKα knockdown, HL-60 to DGKζ silencing, whereas K562 and THP-1 were resistant to both. These findings indicate that DGKs targeting can effectively reduce AML cell viability.

To predict mortality in older patients with various age-related diseases and infections, including COVID-19, inflammatory biomarkers such as the C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR), and related scores and indexes, i.e. Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), modified GPS (mGPS), and high sensitivity (hs)-mGPS, have been increasingly utilized. Despite their easy affordability and widespread availability, these biomarkers are predominantly assessed for clinical purposes rather than predictive applications, leading to their underutilization in hospitalized older patients. In this study, we investigated the association of CAR, GPS, mGPS, and hs-mGPS with short-term mortality in 3,206 geriatric hospitalized patients admitted for acute conditions, irrespective of admission diagnosis. We observed that unit increases of CAR, and the highest classes of GPS, mGPS, and hs-mGPS were significantly associated with a two- to threefold increased risk of death, even adjusting the risk for different confounding variables. Interestingly, a hs-mGPS of 2 showed the highest effect size. Furthermore, gender analysis indicated a stronger association between all CRP-albumin based parameters and mortality in men, underscoring the gender-specific relevance of inflammation-based circulating parameters in mortality prediction. In conclusion, scores based on serum CRP and albumin levels offer additional guidance for the stratification of in-hospital mortality risk in older patients by providing additional information on the degree of systemic inflammation.",Antonio   Cherubini,CHRNTN66L09I921H

These features make it an ideal laboratory to study both the challenges and opportunities of population aging. This article introduces Age-It, a Research Program designed to leverage Italy’s position at the forefront of global aging to advance transdisciplinary research and inform evidence-based policies and practices on aging. Methods Age-It adopts a life course perspective encompassing individual, family, and societal levels. It conceptualizes “aging well” as the outcome of multi-agent, multi-context processes unfolding from early life through old age. Furthermore, Age-It moves beyond a multidisciplinary approach by fostering true cross-fertilization between biomedical, sociodemographic, and technological sciences. Structured as an umbrella initiative, the program brings together multiple interlinked projects that address diverse dimensions of aging through transdisciplinary and collaborative research. Results The program addresses key limitations in Italy’s current aging research and policy landscape: fragmented data, disciplinary silos, and weak connections between research and policymaking. By integrating biomedical, technological, and socioeconomic perspectives into structured, theory-driven research centers (Spokes), Age-It provides a coordinated and innovative platform for studying aging. Discussion Leveraging Italy’s unique demographic profile and internal heterogeneity, Age-It promotes sustainable aging by harnessing the opportunities embedded in demographic change.

However, this process can paradoxically result in additional, irreversible myocardial damage, known as myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury (MIRI). The goal of this review is to explore the role of specialized pro‐resolving mediators (SPMs) in atherosclerosis and MIRI, and to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting inflammation resolution in these cardiovascular conditions. Methods This review summarizes current preclinical and clinical evidence on the involvement of SPMs in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and MIRI, acknowledging that several cellular and molecular aspects of their mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. Results MIRI is a complex phenomenon in which inflammation, initially triggered during ischemia and further amplified upon reperfusion, plays a central role in its pathogenesis. Various cellular and molecular players mediate the initial pro‐inflammatory response and the subsequent anti‐inflammatory reparative phase following acute myocardial infarction (AMI), contributing both to ischemia‐ and reperfusion‐induced damage as well as to the healing process. SPMs have emerged as key endogenous immunoresolvents with potent anti‐inflammatory, antioxidant, and pro‐resolving properties that contribute to limit excessive acute inflammation and promote tissue repair. While dysregulated SPM‐related signaling has been linked to various cardiovascular diseases (CVD), their precise role in AMI and MIRI remains incompletely understood. Conclusion Targeting inflammation resolution may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating atheroprogression and addressing a complex condition such as MIRI.",Anna  De Bartolo,DBRNNA92E64D086T

The oxidoreductase Selenoprotein T (SELENOT) emerged as a key regulator during rat cardiogenesis and acute cardiac protection. However, its action in chronic settings of cardiac dysfunction is not understood. Here, we investigated the role of SELENOT in the pathophysiology of HF: (i) by designing a small peptide (PSELT), recapitulating SELENOT activity via the redox site, and assessed its beneficial action in a preclinical model of HF [aged spontaneously hypertensive heart failure (SHHF) rats] and against isoproterenol (ISO)-induced hypertrophy in rat ventricular H9c2 and adult human AC16 cardiomyocytes; (ii) by evaluating the SELENOT intra-cardiomyocyte production and secretion under hypertrophied stimulation. Results showed that PSELT attenuated systemic inflammation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage M1 polarization, myocardial injury, and the severe ultrastructural alterations, while counteracting key mediators of cardiac fibrosis, aging, and DNA damage and restoring desmin downregulation and SELENOT upregulation in the failing hearts. In the hemodynamic assessment, PSELT improved the contractile impairment at baseline and following ischemia/reperfusion injury, and reduced infarct size in normal and failing hearts. At cellular level, PSELT counteracted ISO-mediated hypertrophy and ultrastructural alterations through its redox motif, while mitigating ISO-triggered SELENOT intracellular production and secretion, a phenomenon that presumably reflects the extent of cell damage. Altogether, these results indicate that SELENOT could represent a novel sensor of hypertrophied cardiomyocytes and a potential PSELT-based new therapeutic approach in myocardial hypertrophy and HF.

According to cancer expression databases, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibits significant overexpression of multiple DGK isoforms, including DGKA, DGKD and DGKG, without a precise correlation with specific AML subtypes. In the TGCA database, high DGKA expression negatively correlates with survival, while high DGKG expression is associated with a more favorable prognosis. DGKA and DGKG also feature different patterns of co-expressed genes. Conversely, the BeatAML and TARGET databases show that high DGKH expression is correlated with shorter survival. To assess the suitability of DGKs as therapeutic targets, we treated HL-60 and HEL cells with DGK inhibitors and compared cell growth and survival with those of untransformed lymphocytes. We observed a specific sensitivity to R59022 and R59949, two poorly selective inhibitors, which promoted cytotoxicity and cell accumulation in the S phase in both cell lines. Conversely, the DGKA-specific inhibitors CU-3 and AMB639752 showed poor efficacy. These findings underscore the pivotal and isoform-specific involvement of DGKs in AML, offering a promising pathway for the identification of potential therapeutic targets.

Efficient TCR signalling requires the inhibition of the alpha isoform of diacylglycerol kinase, DGKα, by an unidentified signalling pathway triggered by the protein adaptor SAP. We previously demonstrated that, in SAP absence, excessive DGKα activity makes the T cells resistant to restimulation-induced cell death (RICD), an apoptotic program counteracting excessive T cell clonal expansion. Results Herein, we report that the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) inhibits DGKα through a specific interaction of the DGKα recoverin homology domain with the WH1 domain of WASp. Indeed, WASp is necessary and sufficient for DGKα inhibition, and this WASp function is independent of ARP2/3 activity. The adaptor protein NCK-1 and the small G protein CDC42 connect WASp-mediated DGKα inhibition to SAP and the TCR signalosome. In primary human T cells, this new signalling pathway is necessary for a full response in terms of IL-2 production, while minimally affecting TCR signalling and restimulation-induced cell death. Conversely, in T cells made resistant to RICD by SAP silencing, the enhanced DAG signalling due to DGKα inhibition is sufficient to restore apoptosis sensitivity. Conclusion We discover a novel signalling pathway where, upon strong TCR activation, the complex between WASp and DGKα blocks DGKα activity, allowing a full cytokine response.",Andrea Graziani,GRZNDR58C11E625X

This cross-sectional study investigated whether and to what extent personal views of aging (VoA)—individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and expectations regarding their own aging—and psychological resilience are associated with QoL and its domains in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: A sample of 224 individuals (46–85 years) was recruited. All participants reported their felt age (FA) and completed the Awareness of Age-Related Change (AARC) questionnaire, assessing awareness of age-related gains (AARC-Gains) and losses (AARC-Losses). They also completed the World Health Organization Quality of Life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF) and the Connor–Davidson Resilience Scale for psychological resilience. Multiple regressions and path analyses were run to examine the associations among personal VoA, psychological resilience, and QoL. Results: Regression analyses showed that AARC-Gains and AARC-Losses (but not FA) predicted overall QoL, with AARC-Losses and, to some extent, FA also explaining specific QoL domains. Resilience also emerged as a significant positive predictor for overall QoL and its psychological and environmental domains. Path analyses confirmed and extended the role of personal VoA and resilience on QoL. Resilience directly influenced QoL and its domains, in turn mediating the effects of personal VoA, depending on the specific facets of VoA and the QoL domains examined. Conclusions: These findings suggest that promoting positive/correct personal views of aging and fostering psychological resilience may be promising healthcare strategies for enhancing QoL in adulthood into older age.",Erika Borella,BRLRKE73T59G535J

During finger-point reading, the finger appears to be ahead of the voice most of the times, by a margin that is significantly modulated by the distribution of phrasal and prosodic units in the reading text. Eye movements replicate the same effects on a different time scale. The eye is ahead of both voice and finger by a wide margin (confirming evidence observed for English and German sentence reading), while showing a tendency to re-synchronise with voice articulation at the right edge of strong prosodic units (sentence boundaries). Our evidence suggests a multicomponent view of the time span between the eye/finger and the voice. The span is shown to be the dynamic outcome of an optimally adaptive reading strategy, resulting from the interaction between individual decoding skills, the reader’s phonological buffer capacity, and the structural complexity of a reading text. Proficient readers modulate their span to compensate for the different timing between word fixation and word articulation, read faster, and dynamically adjust their processing window to the meaningful, prosodic units of a text.",Vito  Pirrelli,PRRVTI61S01A662V

With the recent advances in paleogenomics, it is now possible to investigate to what extent ancient population ancestries contribute to complex traits. In this study, we explored the role of ancient genetic components in human longevity by focusing on the Italian Peninsula, whose genetic heritage includes several past genetic ancestries that have contributed to the current European genetic make-up. We analyzed genome-wide data of 333 Italian centenarians and 690 geographically matched healthy controls, and compared their genetic composition to 103 ancient genomes representative of the main past European population ancestries. Our findings indicate that Italian centenarians have a higher genetic affinity with Western Hunter-Gatherer (WHG)-related ancestry compared to controls, according to PCA and f4-statistics. Logistic regression models based on supervised admixture revealed a significant association between higher WHG ancestry and the centenarian status. Additionally, residual-based predictive analysis showed that centenarians exhibit a significantly higher WHG contribution independent of the genetic structuring of the general Italian population. By painting the chromosomes of modern Italians, we also showed a significantly higher number of WHG alleles at pro-longevity SNPs. In the present study, we demonstrate the contribution of ancient genetic components to the longevity phenotype. In particular, we showed a greater contribution from Western Hunter-Gatherer-related ancestry to Italian centenarians, thus suggesting that this pre-Neolithic genetic component, which has been linked to population shifts occurring within Europe after the Last Glacial Maximum, could be beneficial for longevity today.

Conversely, social isolation is a predictor of shorter lifespan. The biological processes through which sociality affects the ageing process, as well as healthspan and lifespan, are still poorly understood. Unveiling the physiological, neurological, genomic, epigenomic, and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the association between sociality and longevity may open new perspectives to understand how lifespan is determined in a broader socio/evolutionary outlook. Here we summarize evidence showing how social dynamics can shape the evolution of life history traits through physiological and genetic processes directly or indirectly related to ageing and lifespan. We start by reviewing theories of ageing that incorporate social interactions into their model. Then, we address the link between sociality and lifespan from two separate points of view: (i) considering evidences from comparative evolutionary biology and bioanthropology that demonstrates how sociality contributes to natural variation in lifespan over the course of human evolution and among different human groups in both pre-industrial and post-industrial society, and (ii) discussing the main physiological, neurological, genetic, and epigenetic molecular processes at the interface between sociality and ageing. We highlight that the exposure to chronic social stressors deregulates neurophysiological and immunological pathways and promotes accelerated ageing and thereby reducing lifespan. In conclusion, we describe how sociality and social dynamics are intimately embedded in human biology, influencing healthy ageing and lifespan, and we highlight the need to foster interdisciplinary approaches including social sciences, biological anthropology, human ecology, physiology, and genetics.",Cristina Giuliani,GLNCST86C58C573G

Besides the genetic background, epigenetic modifications like DNA methylation, that can modulate cell function, have been particularly studied in this framework.

After briefly discussing the biological bases of sex determination in humans, we will provide much evidence showing that (i) “innate” mechanisms common to all males and to all females (both genetic and epigenetic) play a major role in sex differences in lifespan; (ii) “variable” genetic and epigenetic patterns, that vary according to context, populations and exposures to different environments, can affect the magnitude of the gap in sex differences in survival. Then we will describe recent findings in the use of epigenetic clocks to uncover sex differences in biological age and thus potentially in mortality. In conclusion, we will discuss how environmental factors cannot be kept apart from the biological factors providing evidence from the field of human ecology.",Cristina Giuliani,GLNCST86C58C573G

These estimators exhibit natural variations across human groups, but data about indigenous populations remain underrepresented in research. This study aims to investigate differences in epigenetic estimators between two distinct human populations, both residing in the Gran Chaco region of Argentina, the Native-American Wichí, and admixed Criollos who are descendants of intermarriages between Native Americans and the first European colonizers, using a population genetic approach. Methodology We analyzed 24 Wichí (mean age: 39.2 ± 12.9 yo) and 24 Criollos (mean age: 41.1 ± 14.0 yo) for DNA methylation levels using the Infinium MethylationEPIC (Illumina) to calculate 16 epigenetic estimators. Additionally, we examined genome-wide genetic variation using the HumanOmniExpress BeadChip (Illumina) to gain insights into the genetic history of these populations. Results Our results indicate that Native-American Wichí are epigenetically older compared to Criollos according to five epigenetic estimators. Analyses within the Criollos population reveal that global ancestry does not influence the differences observed, while local (chromosomal) ancestry shows positive associations between specific SNPs located in genomic regions over-represented by Native-American ancestry and measures of epigenetic age acceleration (AgeAccelHannum). Furthermore, we demonstrate that differences in population ecologies also contribute to observed epigenetic differences. Conclusions and implications Overall, our study suggests that while the genomic history may partially account for the observed epigenetic differences, non-genetic factors, such as lifestyle and ecological factors, play a substantial role in the variability of epigenetic estimators, thereby contributing to variations in human epigenetic aging.",Cristina Giuliani,GLNCST86C58C573G

Through kinetic analyses, we demonstrate that a buried cysteine residue stabilizes both an early folding intermediate and the main transition state. Most notably, such effects are disrupted upon substitution with serine but preserved with alanine. These findings suggest that, in certain structural contexts, cysteine behaves as a hydrophobic rather than a polar residue.

These multifunctional molecules contain multiple binding modules that enhance the efficiency and flexibility of cellular signaling pathways, thereby orchestrating complex responses. Among these proteins, Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) emerges as a key regulator owing to its unique ""sandwich"" structure. Despite lacking intrinsic enzymatic activity, recent investigations have revealed that Grb2 acts not merely as a passive bridge but also utilizes intramolecular allosteric communication to modulate binding specificity. In this study, we compared the kinetic binding properties of SH2-SH3 belonging to Grb2 with Gab2 and the same experiment with bound states of the SH2 domain using two different peptides that mimics the physiological ligands of SH2. Our results demonstrate that the SH2 domain plays a critical regulatory role, exhibiting remarkably distinct behaviors in free and bound states, and depending on the ligand it binds to.

The PhosphoTyrosine-Binding domains (PTB) play a pivotal role in regulating several cellular events, by recognizing phosphorylated and, in some cases, non-phosphorylated ligands. In this study we investigated the folding and functional properties of the PTB domain of FRS2 (Fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2) under oxidative and reductive experimental conditions. Results demonstrate a surprising and previously undetected role of a disulfide bond between Cys61 and Cys80 residues in such events. Through an extensive site-directed mutagenesis we demonstrated that the presence/absence of such disulfide bridge, although not changing dramatically the overall structure of the domain, significantly influence its dynamic properties by rewiring a subtle energetic network stabilizing the domain. These effects result in remodulating its binding properties with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides. Molecular dynamics simulations further elucidated how the oxidative/reductive conditions modulate the dynamics of the domain. Finally, we identified lead inhibitory compounds with different efficacy observed across the oxidized and reduced states of the PTB domain. Altogether, these findings provide novel insights for understanding the mechanism of regulation of the function of the PTB domain of FRS2.",Stefano Gianni,GNNSFN76A27H501Z

Among them, Filipino women have emerged as a central and long-established labour force within Italy’s eldercare system. Many are now ageing themselves—continuing to work well beyond retirement age while supporting families across borders through remittances. This research investigates the ageing experiences of Filipino caregivers in Italy, focusing on how family obligations shape their later life. Drawing on 20 in-depth interviews and participant observation in Bologna and Modena, the study explores how ageing is negotiated through moral sacrifice, the deferral of personal needs, and enduring transnational commitments. Theoretical insights from transnational ageing, family ambivalence, and moral obligation guide the analysis, revealing how these women age as both caregivers and migrants, often without adequate welfare protections or familial support. Family emerges as a paradoxical structure—providing emotional meaning yet constraining autonomy and rest. The research challenges normative models of ageing as disengagement or retirement, highlighting instead how work continues to structure the lives of older migrant women. By centring their voices, the study contributes to broader debates on ageing, migration, and care in contemporary Europe.",Lucrezia Alice Moschetta,MSCLRZ96R65L736D

In this study, the tandem PDZ1–PDZ2 domains of the scaffold protein X11, a system of particular interest due to its previously reported asymmetric folding and unfolding behavior as well as its propensity to form transient misfolded intermediates, are investigated. Through extensive mutational work and in‐depth kinetic folding analysis, the folding behavior of this multidomain construct is dissected, and a comparative analysis with its isolated PDZ domains is also performed. The results reveal that folding and unfolding proceed through distinct pathways with PDZ2 folding rapidly and independently, while PDZ1 folds more slowly and only upon engagement of an autoinhibitory regulatory tail. Despite these differences, the folding mechanisms of each domain are conserved when studied in isolation, with deviations largely confined to functionally relevant and frustrated regions. The results also allow to depict the structural features of a misfolded intermediate that competes with productive folding and is stabilized by non‐native interdomain contacts. Strikingly, this misfolded trap retains elements of the PDZ2 folding nucleus, an unexpected finding that allows us to draw broader conclusions about how transient misfolding can arise even from native‐like structural motifs.

The primary outcome was fecal water (FW) genotoxicity at baseline and after 12 weeks; secondary outcomes included FW cytotoxicity, lipoperoxidation, fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bile acids, and blood biomarkers related to iron metabolism and inflammation, also measured pre- and post-intervention. Mixed-effects linear models (time × diet), adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, were applied. FW genotoxicity increased significantly after MBD (+ 15.97%DNA damage; 95% CI 4.61 to 27.32; p = 0.006), with no significant within-group changes in MBD-T or PVD. Between-diet differences in change indicated greater increases in fecal TBARS following MBD (p = 0.010) and MBD-T (p = 0.037) compared with PVD, and a significantly greater increase in 4-HNE after MBD compared with PVD (p = 0.019). The FW Viability Index decreased significantly after MBD (p = 0.021). Differences in change between diets were also significant for circulating ferritin and inflammatory markers, which increased more after MBD compared with PVD (ferritin, IL-6, TNF-α), whereas MBD-T reduced TNF-α and PVD decreased IL-8, TNF-α, and ICAM. No significant between-diet differences in change were observed for fecal SCFAs or bile acids. In summary, over 12 weeks in a free-living setting, a MBD increased several mechanistic biomarkers associated with CRC, while α-tocopherol supplementation attenuated some adverse diet-related effects. In contrast, a PVD was associated with a more favorable biochemical and inflammatory profile. These findings reflect short-term modulation of mechanistic biomarkers rather than CRC outcomes.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03416777.

For PPIs to fulfill their biological functions, they require the specific recognition of a multitude of interacting partners. In many cases, however, protein–protein interaction domains are capable of binding different partners in the intracellular environment, but they require precise regulation of the binding events in order to exert their function properly and avoid misregulation of important molecular pathways. In this work, we focused on the MATH domain of the E3 Ligase adaptor protein SPOP in order to decipher the molecular features underlying its interaction with two different peptides that mimic its physiological partners: Puc and MacroH2A. By employing stopped-flow kinetic binding experiments, together with extensive site-directed mutagenesis, we addressed the roles of specific residues, some of which, although far from the binding site, govern these transient interactions. Our findings are compatible with a scenario in which the binding of the MATH domain with its substrate is characterized by a fine energetic network that regulates its interactions with different ligands. Results are briefly discussed in the context of previously existing work regarding the MATH domain.",Stefano Gianni,GNNSFN76A27H501Z

Here, we tracked changes in vaginal microbiota during four key menstrual cycle phases in 61 healthy, naturally menstruating Italian women from the Women4Health cohort. The microbiota, characterized using a high-depth 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach covering four hypervariable regions, was primarily composed of Lactobacillus species, with Lactobacillus iners being the most abundant (average relative abundance: 40%) and the most prevalent (prevalence: 98%). Individual microbiota were generally stable, but beta diversity was higher during the follicular phase ( P = 0.007). Only 11 women exhibited compositional shifts, mostly occurring between the follicular and ovulatory phases. Finally, using linear mixed models, we assessed the association between taxa relative abundance and five sex hormones along the menstrual cycle. Among these, 17-beta estradiol showed the largest number of significant associations, linking its increase to a decrease in the relative abundance of taxa that are more common after menopause. Our study highlights specific features of the Italian population and points to the resilience of the vaginal microbiota to physiological hormonal changes. Noteworthy, the observed high abundance of L. iners contrasts with previous studies in European populations, challenging its proposed pathogenic role and suggesting distinct microbiota profiles within Europe. IMPORTANCE The vaginal microbiota plays an important role in women’s health, yet we know little about how it responds to normal hormonal fluctuations. In this study, we followed 61 healthy Italian women over a natural menstrual cycle to explore microbiota changes across different hormonal phases. We found that Lactobacillus iners was the most common species, unlike previous findings in Northern Europe, suggesting population-specific patterns. The common hypothesis that L. iners is invariably linked with poor health is called into question by our findings. They emphasize the importance of considering population context and hormonal status when assessing vaginal health. The vaginal microbiota was generally stable, with only a few changes observed between the follicular and ovulatory phases. When evaluating the association between five sex hormones and taxa abundances, we found that 17-beta estradiol levels had the largest number of significant associations. These highlight an association between increased levels of 17-beta estradiol and increased relative abundance of rare bacterial taxa rather than dominant species like Lactobacillus . Our findings help define what constitutes a “healthy microbiota” in generally healthy Italian women of reproductive age and may inform future strategies for diagnosing or preventing women’s health conditions.",Fabio  Busonero,BSNFBA76A18B354F

It also encompasses social and biological aspects often neglected and not well-understood, leaving women with insufficient support and attention. With the decline in estrogen levels, starting years before menopause is fully established, women experience various physical symptoms, and the risk of many age-related diseases increases sharply soon after these hormonal changes occur. Notably, these hormonal shifts also significantly impact the vaginal and gut microbiomes, contributing to dysbiosis and influencing the onset and progression of several diseases. Here, we examined the complex and dynamic relationship among aging, menopause, and microbiome changes with a particular focus on the vaginal and gut ecosystems. Emerging research highlights diet as a potential modulator for maintaining microbiome health during menopause.

This study uses information gathered from a nationwide survey to examine how the public and local public transportation users in Italy are perceived. The purpose of the study is to provide indications and to evaluate how frequent and infrequent users value several facets of public transportation services, such as accessibility, cost, frequency, cleanliness, timeliness, and environmental impact. A wide range of demographic samples contributed responses, offering a thorough picture of regional variations and shared issues. We seek to give a thorough overview of the factors influencing public transportation enjoyment and its implications for practice and policy by synthesizing recent research and empirical data. The findings highlight the significant challenge of changing travel habits, given that 72% of respondents own a car and 87% prefer private transportation over public options. This underscores the importance of promoting more sustainable. mobility options through advancements in public transportation infrastructure, safety perceptions, and urban design.

To address this issue, here we present the comparative analysis of the folding of a tandem repeat protein, comprising two contiguous PDZ domains, in comparison to that of its isolated constituent domains. By analyzing in detail the equilibrium and kinetics of folding at different experimental conditions, we demonstrate that despite each of the PDZ domains in isolation being capable of independent folding, at variance with previously characterized PDZ tandem repeats, the full-length construct folds and unfolds as a single cooperative unit. By exploiting quantitatively, the comparison of the folding of the tandem repeat to those observed for its constituent domains, as well as by characterizing a truncated variant lacking a short autoinhibitory segment, we successfully rationalize the molecular basis of the observed cooperativity and attempt to infer some general conclusions for multidomain systems.",Stefano Gianni,GNNSFN76A27H501Z

Several studies reveal that the upregulation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors in senescent cells is accompanied by increased autophagic activity to counteract the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Our study shows that Doxo-induced senescent fibroblasts yield several SASP factors and exhibit increased autophagy. Interestingly, Quercetin, a bioactive flavonoid, reduces autophagy, increases ER stress, and partially triggers senescent fibroblast death. Given the role of senescent cells in cancer progression, we tested the effect of conditioned media from untreated and quercetin-treated senescent fibroblasts on osteosarcoma cells to determine whether senolytic treatment affected tumour cell behaviour. We report that the partial senescent fibroblast clearance, achieved by quercetin, reduced osteosarcoma cell invasiveness, curbing the pro-tumour effects of senescent cells. The reduction of cell autophagic activity and increased ER stress, an undescribed effect of quercetin, emerges as a new vulnerability of Doxo-induced senescent fibroblasts and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment, suggesting novel drug combinations as a promising strategy against the tumour.",Daniela Monti,MNTDNL58E59F097L

Mapping the mtDNA mutation spectrum and quantifying heteroplasmy are complex tasks when using next-generation sequencing methods, mostly due to NuMTs contamination in data analysis. Results Here, we present a novel, easy-to-use standalone command-line tool designed to reliably discriminate long reads originated by either mtDNA or NuMTs and generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing based on the known lack of CpG methylation in human mtDNA. MitSorter aligns the reads to the mitochondrial genome incorporating base modification calls directly from raw POD5 files. The resulting BAM file is then partitioned into two separate BAM files: one containing unmethylated reads and the other containing methylated reads. We show that MitSorter analysis can provide a more accurate landscape of the mtDNA mutation profile. We describe here the tool's features, computational framework, validation approach, and its potential applications in other genomic research areas.

Recent advances in benchtop NMR technology have sought to overcome these barriers by providing more compact, affordable, and user-friendly instruments. This systematic review aims to assess the potential of benchtop NMR in clinical metabolomics, highlighting its practical advantages, current applications, and technological challenges relative to high-field systems. Methods: For this systematic review we searched Web of Science and PubMed databases to identify studies employing benchtop NMR spectroscopy in clinical and biomedical applications. The review focuses on works that evaluated metabolic profiling in human and animal disease contexts, compared benchtop and high-field performance, and utilized advanced data analysis methods, including multivariate and machine learning approaches. Results: Among the 74 records identified, 15 research articles were eligible, including 11 studies involving human biospecimens and 4 studies concerning animal samples. The selected works were published between 2018 and 2025. These studies demonstrated the potential clinical utility of low-field NMR in differentiating disease states such as tuberculosis, type 2 diabetes, neonatal sepsis, and chronic kidney disease, achieving diagnostic accuracies comparable to high-field instruments. Conclusions: Although limited by lower sensitivity and spectral resolution, benchtop NMR represents a significant step toward the democratization of NMR-based metabolomics. Continued hardware development, improved pulse sequences, and the integration of artificial intelligence for spectral processing and modeling are expected to enhance its analytical power and accelerate its clinical adoption.",Alessia Vignoli,VGNLSS88M42D612Z

Methods A multi‐omics analysis was performed on saliva and stool samples collected from 50 systemically healthy individuals with and without Stage III–IV periodontitis. For participants with periodontitis, samples were analyzed both at baseline and 3 months after Steps I–II of periodontal therapy. High‐throughput whole metagenome sequencing was used to profile microbial taxa and functional genes, NMR‐based metabolomics profiled host–microbial metabolites. Single‐omic differential abundance analysis between healthy samples and periodontitis samples was performed with MaAsLin2, while analysis between pre‐ and post‐treatment was conducted with timeOmics. Variable selection and subsequent supervised multivariate analysis to determine group‐separating markers utilized multi‐level sparse Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (sPLS‐DA) through mixOmics. KEGG pathway enrichment was analyzed using clusterProfiler, whereas multi‐omic data integration was performed with multi‐block Partial Least Squares regression analysis. Results Periodontitis was associated with significant compositional and functional changes in both saliva and stool, with increased abundance of pathobionts and loss of health‐associated taxa in both niches. A subset of species was shared across oral and gut habitats, with detectable differences across clinical groups. As functional potential, periodontitis enriched microbial pro‐inflammatory pathways (lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, bacterial motility) and depleted beneficial short‐chain fatty acid (SCFA)‐ and vitamin‐producing functions. Metabolomic profiles revealed reduced SCFAs and amino acids in periodontitis, with elevated pro‐inflammatory metabolites (succinate, trimethylamine) in both saliva and stool. Following therapy, microbial communities and their metabolic output partially reverted toward health‐associated profiles, particularly in saliva. Stool samples showed subtler but consistent shifts, including a decrease in some typically oral species and decreased succinate and methylamine and restoration of amino acid and SCFA‐related metabolites. Conclusions Periodontitis is associated with coordinated microbial and metabolic signatures across the oral and gut environments. Non‐surgical periodontal therapy promotes partial ecological restoration in both niches, supporting the view of oral health as a modifiable target for influencing systemic microbial homeostasis.

Here, we discovered that the human DNA sequence C16ORF70 encodes a protein, named MYTHO (macroautophagy and youth optimizer), which controls life span and health span. MYTHO protein is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans and its mRNA was upregulated in aged mice and elderly people. Deletion of the orthologous myt-1 gene in C. elegans dramatically shortened life span and decreased animal survival upon exposure to oxidative stress. Mechanistically, MYTHO is required for autophagy likely because it acts as a scaffold that binds WIPI2 and BCAS3 to recruit and assemble the conjugation system at the phagophore, the nascent autophagosome. We conclude that MYTHO is a transcriptionally regulated initiator of autophagy that is central in promoting stress resistance and healthy aging.",Marco Sandri,SNDMRC67S05G224T

Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers exert neurotoxic and pro-inflammatory effects. Astrocytes maintain brain homeostasis, and their dysfunction contributes to AD progression. This study investigates the impact of Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers on primary human astrocytes from healthy individuals and AD patients. Our findings show that astrocytes from both groups internalise Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers. In healthy astrocytes, internalisation enhances proteasome activity, whereas in AD astrocytes, it reduces it. Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers induce calcium dyshomeostasis and mitochondrial membrane potential alterations in both groups. Interestingly, oligomers induce apoptosis in a subset of healthy astrocytes, while surviving ones become reactive and hyperproliferative, releasing neuroinflammatory and neurotrophic molecules. Conversely, Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> drives AD astrocytes into senescence, characterised by increased β-galactosidase activity, p14<sup>ARF</sup> expression, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and heterochromatin foci. Importantly, conditioned media from Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-treated AD astrocytes, but not from healthy ones, cause death of differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells, suggesting that senescent astrocytes contribute to neurotoxicity. These findings reveal differential astrocytic responses to Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> oligomers, emphasising the importance of astrocyte senescence in AD pathogenesis.

Cellular senescence is recognized as a significant contributor to aging and neurodegenerative disorders. This review examines the emerging role of nutraceuticals and functional foods as potential modulators of cellular senescence, which may, in turn, influence the development of neurodegenerative diseases. An analysis of both epidemiological and experimental studies indicates that bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, vitamins, and spices, possess substantial antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and epigenetic properties. These nutritional senotherapeutic agents effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species, modulate gene expression, and decrease the secretion of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors, minimizing cellular damage. Nutraceuticals can enhance mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and regulate inflammation, key factors in aging and diseases like Alzheimer&#039;s and Parkinson&#039;s. Furthermore, studies reveal that specific bioactive compounds can reduce senescence markers in cellular models, while others exhibit senostatic and senolytic properties, both directly and indirectly. Diets enriched with these nutraceuticals, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been correlated with improved brain health and the deceleration of aging. Despite these promising outcomes, direct evidence linking these compounds to reducing senescent cell numbers remains limited, highlighting the necessity for further inquiry. This review presents compelling arguments for the potential of nutraceuticals and functional foods to promote longevity and counteract neurodegeneration by exploring their molecular mechanisms. The emerging relationship between dietary bioactives and cellular senescence sets the stage for future research to develop effective preventive and therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases.",Sara Ristori,RSTSRA92D51A851V

To date, the mechanisms underlying these differences remain unknown. Given the rising incidence of such diseases, gender-specific research on established and emerging risk factors, such as dysfunction of glycaemic and/or lipid metabolism, of sex hormones and of gut microbiome, is of paramount importance. The relationships between sex hormones, gut microbiome, and host glycaemic and/or lipid metabolism are largely unknown even in the homoeostasis status. Yet this knowledge gap would be pivotal to pinpoint to key mechanisms that are likely to be disrupted in disease context. Methods and results Here we present the Women4Health (W4H) cohort, a unique cohort comprising up to 300 healthy women followed up during a natural menstrual cycle, set up with the primary goal to investigate the combined role of sex hormones and gut microbiota variations in regulating host lipid and glucose metabolism during homoeostasis, using a multi-omics strategy. Additionally, the W4H cohort will take into consideration another ecosystem that is unique to women, the vaginal microbiome, investigating its interaction with gut microbiome and exploring—for the first time—its role in cardiometabolic disorders.

Consequently, several pathologies arise from the dysregulation of such SH2-domains mediated PPIs. In this review, we recapitulate the current knowledge about the structural, folding stability, and binding properties of SH2 domains and their roles in molecular pathways and pathogenesis. Moreover, we focus attention on the different strategies employed to modulate/inhibit SH2 domains binding. Altogether, the information gathered points to evidence that pharmacological interest in SH2 domains is highly strategic to developing new therapeutics.

An example is PDZD2, a protein characterized by the presence of six PDZ domains that undergoes a proteolytic cleavage producing sPDZD2, comprising a tandem of two PDZ domains, namely PDZ5 and PDZ6. Albeit the physiopathological importance of sPDZD2 is well‐established, the interaction with endogenous ligands has been poorly characterized. To understand the determinants of the stability and function of sPDZD2, we investigated its folding pathway. Our data highlights the presence of a complex scenario involving a transiently populated folding intermediate that may be accumulated from the concurrent denaturation of both PDZ5 and PDZ6 domains. Importantly, double jump kinetic experiments allowed us to pinpoint the ability of this transient intermediate to bind the physiological ligand of sPDZD2 with increased affinity compared to the native state. In summary, our results provide an interesting example of a functionally competent misfolded intermediate, which may exert a cryptic function that is not captured from the analysis of the native state only.",Stefano Gianni,GNNSFN76A27H501Z

Among those, Crkl plays key roles in cell physiology by mediating signals from a wide range of stimuli, and its overexpression is associated with several types of cancers. In myeloid cells expressing the oncogene BCR/ABL, one interactor of Crkl-SH2 is the focal adhesion protein Paxillin, and this interaction is crucial in leukemic transformation. In this work, we analyze both the folding pathway of Crkl-SH2 and its binding reaction with a peptide mimicking Paxillin, under different ionic strength and pH conditions, by using means of fluorescence spectroscopy. From a folding perspective, we demonstrate the presence of an intermediate along the reaction. Moreover, we underline the importance of the electrostatic interactions in the early event of recognition, occurring between the phosphorylated tyrosine of the Paxillin peptide and the charge residues of Crkl-SH2.

We carried out a GWAS of 12 morphological traits in 869 individuals from the general population of Sardinia, Italy. These traits, included measures of cell volume, conductivity and light scatter in four white-cell populations (eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils). This analysis yielded seven statistically significant signals, four of which were novel (four novel, PRG2, P2RX3, two of CDK6). Five signals were replicated in the independent INTERVAL cohort of 11 822 individuals. The most interesting signal with large effect size on eosinophil scatter (P-value = 8.33 x 10−32, beta = −1.651, se = 0.1351) falls within the innate immunity cluster on chromosome 11, and is located in the PRG2 gene. Computational analyses revealed that a rare, Sardinian-specific PRG2:p.Ser148Pro mutation modifies PRG2 amino acid contacts and protein dynamics in a manner that could possibly explain the changes observed in eosinophil morphology.

Drawing on data from the 2021 Italian Labour Force Survey ad hoc module, we explore occupational paths of young adults aged 25-34. Adopting a comparative perspective, we differentiate between Italian natives and young adults with a migration background, categorized by their age at arrival. Through discrete-time event history analysis, we reconstruct the median age at which different groups first enter into the labour market. Using logistic regression models, we examine how several determinants such as educational level, parents’ educational level, migration background, and place of residence shape the timing of this event. This research sheds light on the employment paths of immigrant youths, revealing distinct timing for groups with diverse migration backgrounds and educational experiences. A significant finding is the notable disparities in the timing of labour market entry among women across all studied categories, with women entering the labour market at an older age and having significantly lower employment rates compared to men.

These demographic shifts have significant implications for economic and environmental resource allocations and the transformation of social and political status and individual rights. To explore these dynamics, we present findings from Spoke 7 (Cultural and Political Dimensions of Ageing Societies) of the Age-It Research Program, which has developed a novel Index of Intergenerational Justice. Methods The Index of Intergenerational Justice, applied to a broad sample of European countries, captures three key dimensions of justice: distributive fairness, social (status and relational) equality, and political equality. We focus on differences across age groups, rather than across cohorts, due to well-documented challenges in direct cohort comparisons. The distributive fairness dimension covers economics (relative poverty, unemployment, permanent contracts, wages), health (unmet medical needs), and the environment (environmental risk exposure). The social equality dimension captures social isolation (measured through leisure activities, internet access, social contacts, and close relationships), discrimination, and mental well-being. Finally, the political equality dimension considers political perceptions, political engagement, and political representation. Results Preliminary findings reveal substantial differences across age groups in the distributive fairness dimension. A cluster of countries appears to favor older adults, while another favors younger adults. By contrast, in the social equality dimension, nearly all countries tend to favor young adults. Discussion The Intergenerational Justice Index provides a valuable tool for assessing fairness across age groups.

One reason for this is that health professionals are unaware of patients’ lived experience of terror and disorientation. Immersive virtual reality (VR) provides an innovative medium for experiential education, supporting engagement, reflection, and understanding of complex real-world situations. Objective Building on earlier pilot study on VR-based empathy education, this study evaluated a VR delirium simulation created in partnership with delirium survivors and caregivers, focusing on its feasibility, safety, and educational impact. Methods Over two years, four Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) partners (one delirium survivor, two family caregivers, one advocacy expert) co-designed scenario language, safety protocols, and reflection prompts alongside researchers and clinicians. We evaluated a 10-minute VR simulation reproducing delirium phenomenology paired with 25-minute structured reflection. Fifteen clinicians and educators (physicians, nurses, researchers) participated in an international empathy-in-healthcare symposium. Quantitative outcomes (perceived realism, empathy, communication, behavioural intentions) were analyzed descriptively; qualitative reflections were thematically analyzed to explore educational mechanisms and ethical implications. Results Participants rated VR realism and emotional salience highly (means 4.1–4.5, 80-100% agreement). All participants reported stronger perspective-taking, with intended changes including slower speech, environmental control, and caregiver inclusion. Thematic analysis identified affective immersion and cognitive reframing as key mechanisms, alongside risks of emotional overload and oversimplification. PPI-informed safety protocols (pre-briefing, opt-out, quiet space) prevented adverse effects; no withdrawals occurred. Conclusion The VR simulation was a realistic, emotionally engaging, and educationally meaningful medium for delirium training. This approach may foster greater empathy and intentional changes in communication and care practices In delirium care.

For this reason, this study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the most pursued improvement objectives, performance measurement indicators, and data collection tools and techniques of HLM implementations within TAH. Methods Following the PRISMA protocol, a scoping literature review was conducted to investigate the linkages among improvement objectives, performance measurement indicators, and data collection tools and techniques. Results The current study provides valuable insights into the performance measurement indicators that should be adopted according to the specific improvement objectives. It highlights that measuring and monitoring are essential activities but often overlooked in HLM projects, negatively affecting the effectiveness of this managerial approach in terms of sustainability over time.

In recent years, stakeholders have increasingly pressured organisations to integrate sustainability into their operations, underscoring the need to expand lean management practices by incorporating environmental and social considerations, such as the implementation of sustainable VSM. Unlike traditional VSM, which primarily focuses on customer (i.e., patient) value, sustainable VSM addresses the needs of a broader range of stakeholders, including patients, employees (healthcare staff), labour/professional unions, insurers, local communities, and regulatory bodies. This study aims to systematically identify the metrics used in VSM within the healthcare sector and propose an expanded metrics-based VSM that integrates economic, environmental, and social dimensions. A systematic literature review on sustainable VSM was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The review indicates that current VSM practices in healthcare focus on metrics related to time, efficiency, capacity, cost, patient safety, and patient satisfaction. However, the healthcare sector also has significant implications for sustainability, including environmental aspects (e.g., resource consumption and healthcare waste management) and social aspects (e.g., occupational health and safety, and stakeholder satisfaction). To address these broader considerations, this study expands the existing application of VSM in healthcare by adapting multidimensional metrics commonly used in sustainable VSM in the manufacturing sector. This approach aims to achieve comprehensive outcomes by enhancing the quality of patient-centred care, while minimising resource consumption (materials, energy, and water), ensuring effective healthcare waste management, promoting health and safety, and improving the satisfaction of patients and other stakeholders. This study establishes a theoretical foundation for future research on integrating lean practices and sustainability. Additionally, it offers actionable insights for healthcare organisations seeking to implement a comprehensive approach to VSM that improves efficiency, care quality, and sustainability.",Anna Tiso,TSINNA94M44B563L

To this end, this paper aims to focus on adopting Health Lean Management (HLM), a widely used managerial approach, to improve the performance and quality of care provided in chronic care pathways. HLM addresses not only efficiency and timeliness issues but also care effectiveness and integration. Indeed, the lack of continuity and co-ordination of care constitutes a major challenge for chronic pathways. This research provides an innovative contribution, by extending the implementation of HLM to chronic pathways developed across hospital and territorial care. Indeed, HLM scope typically regards hospital units and departments; hence, analysing the interaction between different levels of care represents a novelty from an academic and practical perspective. Design/methodology/approach With the aim of understanding how to extend the adoption of HLM towards the territory, an action research project has been developed. In particular, an improvement project focused on breast cancer care pathways has been launched in a Spanish hospital. The research investigates which HLM activities, tools and practices need to be accomplished in this kind of project, grasping insights into emerging wastes. To this end, the HLM project followed the Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve and Control (DMAIC) cycle, supporting the project team in effectively conducting a preliminary context analysis, qualitative and quantitative data collection, the current state analysis and the countermeasure proposals. Findings The analysis conducted on the breast cancer care pathway highlighted major criticalities in managing the diagnosis of new patients. In particular, waiting times to obtain diagnostic imaging and breast specialist consultations highly impacted the care pathway effectiveness and efficiency. Specific wastes that caused these delays have been investigated, leading to the definition of specific countermeasures that could minimise the inefficiencies: an 85% reduction of the staging process lead time was estimated. Originality/value The achieved results contribute to enhancing the quality of care delivered to breast cancer patients. This paper enriches the theoretical knowledge about HLM, extending its typical field of application; provides practical support to health-care providers, managers and leaders with a case demonstrating how to develop HLM projects adopting the DMAIC cycle; and finally, it has valuable social implications, addressing the global threat of chronic disease.",Anna Tiso,TSINNA94M44B563L

Despite its importance, many countries fail to ensure equitable access and individualised care. This problem significantly impacts the most vulnerable part of the population, such as chronic and elderly patients. In this context, considering the large number of people affected by multiple diseases, multidisciplinary and multi-organisation teamwork has become fundamental to guarantee high levels of quality, increasing patient satisfaction, and continuity of care. Furthermore, working in a multidisciplinary primary care team can improve information exchange between care providers and patients, positively impacting on clinical performance. Despite these opportunities, the primary care workforce is often overloaded in its daily activities and not adequately organised and coordinated to avoid burnout experiences and inefficient skills deployment. In this context, implementing Lean and Safety Management (L&SM) as a process improvement methodology can increase care pathways performance and integration, patient safety and satisfaction through the reduction of wastes and risks. The current study aims to implement L&SM in a primary care centre in Italy, with the final goal of increasing productivity and effectiveness in daily activities performed by primary care physicians. This project is carried out following the DMAIC cycle; a managerial approach that combines qualitative and quantitative techniques to support process improvement. The implementation roadmap will combine HLM and CRM, planning to achieve the main steps listed as follows: mapping the care demand and the available resources to define the focus of the study; identifying the most representative and critical patients; mapping the target care pathway; identifying wastes and risk and their root causes; identifying critical aspects and improvement events; implementing countermeasures; evaluating and monitoring results. The expected results of the forthcoming months consist of measurable improvements within the healthcare pathway, supporting the optimisation of the primary care centre. Moreover, this initiative may represent a pilot case for other similar projects, contributing to spread L&SM culture throughout primary care centres with benefits for both patients and clinical staff.",Anna Tiso,TSINNA94M44B563L

We hypothesised that daily customer incivility reported at the end of the previous workday would predict decreases in next-day morning employees' self-esteem. In turn, lowered self-esteem would be related to lower job satisfaction levels at the end of the same workday. Additionally, we predicted that the link between lowered self-esteem and lowered job satisfaction would be weaker for employees who engaged more in deep acting. To test our hypotheses, we conducted a daily study on 144 customer-contact employees. Participants completed online questionnaires for 31 days reporting their morning self-esteem levels, together with evening customer incivility and job satisfaction levels. The data were analysed using dynamic structural equation models that allow examining intra-person time series trends, on a day-to-day level, while estimating individual differences therein. Consistent with our predictions, the results provided evidence for the short-term detrimental effects of customer incivility on next-day job satisfaction through lowered self-esteem and for the buffering role of deep acting.

The traditional challenge of achieving a fine-grained assessment of health resource statistics and evaluating the fairness of health services across regions is a concern in current research on the fairness of health services. In this study, the authors propose a methodological approach to foster a novel analysis of fairness in the allocation of primary health care services in Italy with a specific focus on the population aged 65 or over, which facilitates the processing of extensive administrative and demographic data to ensure a clear and precise visualization for informed decision making. The proposed methodology integrates convolution matrices weighted by aged population density within a fine-grained geographic grid representation. This approach is combined with an image convolution technique for filtering, enabling an effective estimation of health resource impact and a clear visualization of their spatial distribution across geographical areas. The integration of several data sources to evaluate the equity in accessibility distribution through the Gini index is also exploited to quantify the disparity between healthcare service provision and the aged population at the regional district level. Our findings showed a substantial unfairness in service distribution, with a concentration of healthcare effect in prominent regions such as Campania, Lazio, and Lombardia, indicating that healthcare accessibility is predominantly disproportionate in Italy, particularly for the population aged over 65.",Frida Milella,MLLFRD85P56L049D

The use of pedestrians' bodily responses to the environment, known as the people-centric sensing strategy, has been demonstrated to be more suitable for detecting challenging environmental conditions and enhancing walkability. However, the extent to which such data may accurately pinpoint environmental distress in a particular demographic, such as older adults, has not been thoroughly investigated. The purpose of this in-progress systematic review of the literature is to outline the strategy employed and highlight some preliminary findings on the use of wearable sensors or sensor-based technologies in gathering the bodily responses of older adults and/or their family caregivers to stimuli originating from real urban walking scenarios. Our preliminary findings showed that the current research on using wearable devices to detect bodily responses in older adults (or informal caregivers) population in relation to walkability in outdoor environments tends to exhibit a uniform strategy, that is, collecting physiological and location data from older adults through controlled outdoor walking routes using wrist-wearable and GPS; training supervised classifiers to differentiate between physiological stress and non-stress signals to environmental conditions of external interaction; and finally, using hotspot analysis to group together individual physiological responses in areas with high-stress interactions with the external environment using GIS. Although the body of literature appears to be still in its early stages, using wearable sensors and a GIS-based approach could be a promising method for spatio-temporally capturing people's direct bodily responses to the environmental stressors, and this offer rooms for potential integration of simulation-based models into Digital Twins environments with GIS-based analysis to further enhance our understanding of older adults mobility in urban settings.

We compute the quantifiers on three orchestral compositions: the Ouverture from La forza del destino by G. Verdi, the Prelude from Tristan und Isolde by R. Wagner, and Santa Rosalia by M. Mannone. The obtained string values are then compared with the responses of listeners from different countries, and different ages and musical education levels. The participants in our experiment were asked to listen to the three pieces, clicking a button each time they heard an ""intense"" musical passage.

Methods The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed, and the review was preregistered in PROSPERO (CRD42023407986). Studies presenting VoA instruments, also including a specific focus on views of changes in cognition with aging, were identified using the Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases. Based on the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) guidelines, risk of bias and GRADE assessments were conducted for each instrument. Results Of the 3,578 records emerged, 77 studies assessing measurement properties of 26 VoA instruments in samples of older adults were included. These instruments reflected diverse generalized and personal VoA concepts; few ones assessed or included items depicting views of changes in cognition with aging, with memory being the most frequently addressed cognitive domain. Conclusions Notwithstanding psychometric and measurement issues, this review provides a comprehensive summary of existing instruments assessing subjective VoA, which have clinical and applied utility in promoting healthy aging, especially for older adults at risk of pathological aging. The development and validation of new VoA scales, particularly to assess views on age-related cognitive changes with aging, is warranted.",Erika Borella,BRLRKE73T59G535J

The main objective of the pilot study, “Multidomain Interventions to improve the COgnitive and fUNctional well-being of elderly individuals in residential sTructures” (I-COUNT), is to assess the feasibility of a 6-month multidomain intervention performed on older adults in Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs), compared with a group of residents following a traditional care approach. Methods: The intervention will involve two LTCFs in Italy and will include physical exercise and cognitive training, administered and monitored using wearable technologies, a nutritional program based on the Mediterranean diet enriched with selected functional foods, and the administration of the vaccinations recommended in the national vaccination plan. The I-COUNT study will assess the feasibility and acceptability of the defined protocol and provide information to determine the sample size for a definitive study. In relation to the potential health impact of multidomain interventions on older people living in LTCFs, the primary outcome will consider the change in microbiota composition assessed 3 months after the start of interventions, while secondary outcomes will include the evaluation of changes in selected biomarkers, physical performance, psychological health, cognitive functioning, and nutritional status at 6- and 9-month follow-up points. Conclusions: The I-COUNT study will allow us to assess the feasibility of delivering a multidomain intervention on elderly people.

This study aimed to examine personal VoA, particularly felt age (FA) and awareness of age-related change (AARC), in caregivers of people with dementia (PwD) compared to non-caregivers, and to ascertain their relationship with caregiving-related burden and distress among dementia caregivers. Methods: Seventy dementia caregivers and 94 non-caregivers (age range: 45–85 years) reported their FA and completed a questionnaire assessing awareness of age-related gains (AARC-Gains) and losses (AARC-Losses) and a mood measure. Dementia caregivers’ burden and distress were also relieved. Results: No differences emerged between dementia caregivers and non-caregivers’ personal VoA. Different sociodemographic and health-related factors were related to AARC-Gains or AARC-Losses, but not felt age, in each group. AARC-Gains were associated with social status among non-caregivers, whereas AARC-Losses were related to chronological age and subclinical depression in non-caregivers, and to social status, self-rated health, and burden in dementia caregivers. A path model revealed a direct effect of burden, social status, and self-rated health, as well as an indirect one of subclinical depression through burden, on caregivers’ AARC-Losses. Conclusions: These findings confirm the interplay between VoA, sociodemographic, and health-related factors in adulthood and older age. They, then, suggest that the strains derived from caring for a PwD influence dementia caregivers’ personal VoA, particularly when their awareness of age-related losses is concerned.",Erika Borella,BRLRKE73T59G535J

Until now, there has been no clear definition of a preventive pathway with the aim of improving lifestyles and promoting healthy and active ageing. The present systematic review aims to provide evidence to support the development of effective ways of delivering preventive pathways for healthy ageing. Methods: Several databases were searched, i.e., MEDLINE, COCHRANE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, by using specific inclusion criteria, such as elderly population (i.e., subjects aged 65 years and older), preventive interventions for healthy ageing, studies with or without control groups, and effectiveness and methodological structure of the prevention pathway. The risk of bias was assessed by using the Joanna Briggs Institute and mixed methods appraisal tools. Results: A total of 9998 studies were identified after the removal of duplicates, and after screening title, abstracts, and full text, 14 studies were finally included. All the prevention pathways described are based on physical activity (PA) programmes, dietary interventions, and cognitive and mental health. The professional figures involved in the pathways were experts in prevention and health promotion, like family and community nurses, kinesiologists, and experts in stress management. The majority of the preventive pathways were implemented in primary care and community settings. Conclusions: Our systematic review provides evidence for developing an effective preventive healthy ageing pathway through tailored PA, diet, and cognitive health interventions. This co-designed approach should involve a multidisciplinary expert team and be implemented in primary care and community settings to improve psycho-physical health and longevity.",Alice Masini,MSNLCA93B57E463O

Based on the PRISMA guidelines and preregistering in PROSPERO (CRD42022366520), we searched the Scopus, PsycInfo, and Web of Science databases. Out of 2,675 articles, 27 met the inclusion criteria. The synthesized findings on cognition (23 studies) revealed an uncertain influence of music type and presentation modalities on memory outcomes. In contrast, happy-sounding music seems to support executive functioning (2 out of 4) and processing speed (1), when presented in the background, and facilitate language processes (2 out of 3), when given prior to the task. However, the high heterogeneity and inconsistency in the music type and presentation modalities, as well as in the cognitive outcomes considered, prevented us from drawing clear conclusions on the effect of music listening on older adults’ cognition. For affective outcomes, a narrative synthesis of the findings on mood (12 studies) and arousal (7 studies) outcomes showed that, regardless of music presentation modality, happy- and sad-sounding music increase or decrease mood/valence and arousal, respectively. Results from meta-analysis showed no significant cognitive benefits from music listening (SMD = 0.09, [95% CI: −0.17, 0.35], p = 0.51) and suggest a positive effect of happy-sounding music on arousal (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI: 0.13, 0.74], p = 0.005), but not on valence (SMD = 0.79 [95% CI: −0.25, 1.84], p = 0.14). The methodological shortcomings of the extant literature call upon the need for further studies adopting more rigorous and consistent approaches that better elucidate the potential benefits of music listening on cognitive and affective outcomes among older adults.",Erika Borella,BRLRKE73T59G535J

The present cross-sectional study was aimed at examining whether personality traits, as defined by the Big Five model, are associated with different VoA concepts related to both subjective age and awareness of age-related gains and losses in midlife and older age. Materials and methods A sample of 224 participants aged 46–85 years reported their felt age and completed the Awareness of Age-Related Change (AARC) questionnaire, assessing perceptions of age-related gains (AARC-Gains) and losses (AARC-Losses) in various functioning domains, as well as the short version of the Big Five Inventory. Results Linear regression models showed that Openness contributed to explain youthful subjective age. Extraversion explained higher AARC-Gains scores, whereas Emotional Stability, along with younger chronological age and perceiving better self-rated health, contributed to explaining lower AARC-Losses scores. Discussion These findings confirm the relationship between personality traits and personal VoA. They further suggest that such an association varies depending on the VoA measure considered.

Controlled transcriptional dampening of genes surrounding DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been shown to facilitate DNA repair. This phenomenon, defined as DSB-induced silencing in cis (DISC), involves the DDR apical kinase ATM and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1). Conversely, DSBs have also been reported to induce de novo transcription of damaged-induced long non-coding RNAs (dilncRNAs) in a MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MNR) complex-dependent manner. MRN also controls the recruitment to DSB of the ribonuclease DROSHA, which together with DICER, stimulates DDR signaling and DNA repair. Here, we reconcile these apparently contrasting observations by showing that dilncRNA, together with DROSHA and DICER, but not GW182-like proteins required for miRNA-mediated gene silencing, controls DISC. Indeed, similarly to ATM, MRN inhibition abolishes DISC while pharmacological enhancement of DICER ribonuclease activity by Enoxacin improves DISC. Importantly, Enoxacin administration restores DISC upon ATM inhibition, demonstrating that DICER promotes DISC independently from ATM. Differently, Enoxacin does not restore DISC upon MRN inhibition, suggesting that DICER acts downstream to dilncRNA biogenesis and DROSHA recruitment. Mechanistically, we show that DROSHA and DICER control the recruitment of the PRC1 component BMI1 at DSBs and the consequent H2A-K119 ubiquitination. Upon DSBs formation, BMI1 and DROSHA interact in an RNA-dependent manner. Indeed, BMI1 associates to dilncRNA and do so in a DROSHA- and DICER-dependent manner. Importantly, inhibition of dilncRNA function by antisense oligonucleotides or Cas13-mediated targeting is sufficient to reduce BMI1 recruitment and DISC at individual loci. We propose that dilncRNAs together with DROSHA and DICER control DISC at genomic DSB by supporting PRC1 recruitment and chromatin ubiquitination.",Fabrizio D'Adda di Fagagna,DDDFRZ66L28L483G

A sample of 435 adults aged 50 and over completed self-reported measures of soft skills, life satisfaction, and cognitive reserve. As control, fluid (reasoning) and crystalized (vocabulary) intelligence were assessed too, along with socio-demographic characteristics. A series of regression analyses showed that soft skills were positively related to both life satisfaction and, to a lower extent, cognitive reserve, above and beyond gender, age, and both fluid and crystallized intelligence. Interestingly, these associations were independent from participants’ age. Overall, these results highlight the importance of considering soft skills also over the middle-late adult life course, due to the potential role of these individual qualities in supporting an individual’s well-being and an active and engaged lifestyle, with implications for the promotion of a healthy aging.",Erika Borella,BRLRKE73T59G535J

DNA damage is a hallmark of ageing, particularly when occurring at telomeres, genomic regions vulnerable to oxidative damage and often challenging for the cell to repair. Here, we show that brains of 3xTg-AD mice, an established AD model characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced pathology, exhibit increased activation of DNA damage response (DDR) pathways at telomeres. Exposure of mouse primary hippocampal neurons to 42-residue Aβ (Aβ42) oligomers, a significant pathogenetic contributor to AD, triggers telomeric DDR by increasing the levels of reactive oxygen species caused by calcium imbalance. Antisense oligonucleotides targeting non-coding RNAs generated at damaged telomeres in vivo (in 3xTg-AD mice) and in vitro reduce neurotoxicity in iPSC-derived human cortical neurons and mouse primary neurons while inhibiting Aβ42-induced telomeric DDR, and restore transcriptional pathways altered by Aβ and found dysregulated in AD patients.

However, the impact of CIs on DNA damage response (DDR) and repair in this pathology remains unprobed. Here, we show that CIs of TDP-43 and FUS P525L , co-localizing with stress granules, lead to a dysfunctional DDR activation associated with physical DNA breakage. Inhibition of the activity of the DDR kinase ATM, but not of ATR, abolishes DDR signaling, indicating that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are the primary source of DDR activation. In addition, cells with TDP-43 and FUS P525L CIs exhibit reduced DNA damage-induced RNA synthesis at DSBs. We previously showed that the two endoribonucleases DROSHA and DICER, also known to interact with TDP-43 and FUS during small RNA processing, contribute to DDR signaling at DSBs. Treatment with enoxacin, which stimulates DDR and repair by boosting the enzymatic activity of DICER, restores a proficient DDR and reduces DNA damage accumulation in cultured cells with CIs and in vivo in a murine model of ALS. In Drosophila melanogaster , Dicer-2 overexpression rescues TDP-43-mediated retinal degeneration.

Blocking tncRNAs with telomeric antisense oligonucleotides (tASOs) suppresses in vivo DDR signaling and its downstream effects. Here, we show that tASO-mediated inhibition of telomeric DDR in second-generation tert−/− zebrafish embryos with critically short telomeres leads to improved developmental outcomes and rescues premature aging phenotypes, including enhanced survival.

Aged mice offer a valuable model as they share features of cognitive decline with humans. Despite numerous studies, knowledge of longitudinal age‐related cognitive changes and cognitive frailty in naturally aging mice is limited, particularly in cohorts exceeding 30 months of age, where cognitive decline is more pronounced. Moreover, the impaired physical function of aged mice is known to affect latency‐based strategies to measure cognitive performances. Here, we show a comprehensive longitudinal assessment using the Barnes Maze test in a large cohort of 424 aged (≥ 21 months) C57BL/6J mice. We introduced a new metric, the Cognitive Frailty Index (CoFI), which summarizes different age‐associated Barnes Maze parameters into a unique function. CoFI strongly associates with advancing age and mortality, offering a reliable ability to discriminate long‐ and short‐lived mice. We also established a CoFI cut‐off and a physically adjusted CoFI, both of which can distinguish between physical and cognitive frailty. This is further supported by the enhanced predictive power when physical and cognitive frailty are combined to assess short‐term mortality. Moreover, the computation method for CoFI is adaptable to various cognitive assessment tests, leveraging procedures akin to those used for calculating other frailty indices. In conclusion, through robust longitudinal tracking, CoFI has the potential to become an important ally in assessing the effectiveness of Geroscience‐based interventions to counteract age‐related cognitive impairment.",Fabrizio D'Adda di Fagagna,DDDFRZ66L28L483G

The fundamental steps in energy transduction are the working stroke, an inter-domain tilting of the lever arm about the actin-attached catalytic domain, generating up to ∼5 pN force or ∼10 nm of filament sliding, and the release of the ATP hydrolysis product orthophosphate (Pi) from the nucleotide-binding site, which is associated with a large free energy release. The two events are not simultaneous, as first demonstrated by the force response to a stepwise change in [Pi] (the Pi transient), showing the saturation kinetics characteristic of a two-step reaction. However, while high-resolution crystal structures of the myosin motor suggest that Pi release precedes the working stroke, in vitro functional studies indicate that it follows the working stroke. High-resolution sarcomere-level mechanics applied to single muscle fibers, allowing myosin motor synchronization by step perturbations in length or load, revealed that the kinetics of the working stroke is independent of [Pi] and depends only on the load. Moreover, this approach highlights the need for two unconventional pathways of the chemo-mechanical cycle: an early detachment of the force-generating motors and the possibility for attached motors to slip to the next actin monomer farther from the sarcomere center during shortening. Transient and steady-state responses to stepwise changes in load or [Pi] can be fitted with a structurally and biochemically explicit model in which the Pi release step is orthogonal to the progression of the working stroke. Model simulations indicate that the rate of Pi release depends on motor conformation, which resolves longstanding unanswered questions such as the dependence of Pi transient kinetics on the final level of [Pi] under any load and clarifies the issue of the relative timing between the working stroke and Pi release: at high loads, Pi release precedes the execution of the working stroke, while at low loads, the working stroke state transitions are fast enough to occur with Pi still bound to the catalytic site.",Marco Linari,LNRMRC63T30D612D

Creatine Transporter Deficiency (CTD), an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the SLC6A8 gene, disrupts Cr transport, leading to intellectual disability, speech delay, autism, epilepsy, and various non-neurological symptoms. In addition to neurological alterations, Creatine Transporter knockout (CrT −/y ) mice exhibit severe muscle atrophy and functional impairments. This study provides the first characterization of the skeletal muscle phenotype in CrT −/y mice, revealing profound ultrastructural abnormalities accompanied by reduced fiber cross-sectional area and muscle performance. Notably, mitochondria are involved, as evidenced by disrupted cristae, increased mitochondrial size, impaired Ca 2+ uptake, reduced membrane potential and ATP production. Mechanistically, the expression of atrophy-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases and suppression of the IGF1-Akt/PKB pathway, regulated by mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels, further support the atrophic phenotype. These findings highlight the profound impact of Cr deficiency on skeletal muscle, emphasizing the need for targeted therapeutic strategies to address both the neurological and peripheral manifestations of CTD.

Instead, cooling is reported to not affect the force per motor in Ca2+-activated cardiac trabeculae from the rat ventricle. Here, the mechanism of the cardiac performance depression by cooling is reinvestigated with fast sarcomere-level mechanics. We determine the changes in the half-sarcomere compliance of maximally Ca2+-activated demembranated rat trabeculae in the range of temperatures of 10–30 °C and analyse the data in terms of a simplified mechanical model of the half-sarcomere to extract the contribution of myofilaments and myosin motors. We find that the changes in the ensemble force are due to changes in the force per motor, while the fraction of actin-attached motors remains constant independent of temperature. The results demonstrate that in the cardiac myosin, as in the skeletal muscle myosin, the force-generating transition is endothermic. The underlying large heat absorption indicates the interaction of extended hydrophobic surfaces within the myosin motor, like those suggested by the crystallographic model of the working stroke.",Marco Linari,LNRMRC63T30D612D

Methods A systematic review of HA definitions was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. A search strategy was designed, refined, and executed using Medline (Ovid) up to July 19, 2024. The primary search term was “healthy aging,” with results filtered specifically for RCTs. Results Of 38,219 records initially retrieved, 1,588 were screened, and 48 met the inclusion criteria. No unified definition of HA was identified. Instead, three main types emerged: (a) multidimensional definitions with qualitative assessments (29.2%), (b) multidimensional definitions with quantitative assessments (27.0%), and (c) condition- or disease-specific definitions (43.8%). The most common intervention targets were active aging (29.2%), nutritional supplementation (14.6%), cognitive decline (12.5%), and physical activity (12.5%). Considerable heterogeneity was observed in the domains (e.g., physical, cognitive, psychological, and social) and the tools used to assess HA. Discussion The findings highlight substantial conceptual variability in how HA is defined and measured in RCTs. This diversity reflects the multidimensional and context-dependent nature of HA but poses challenges for synthesis and comparison across studies. A shared framework for defining HA in interventional research is needed to support evidence-based aging policies. By mapping the range of operational definitions used in RCTs, this review provides a foundation for standardizing future HA research.",Fulvio  Ricceri,RCCFLV80S26L219B

More specifically, it addresses how the availability of formal public childcare services for children under the age of three and their expansion support women’s labour market participation in different cultural contexts. Few studies have examined cultural and structural factors together. The study integrates individual-level data from the European Social Survey on women’s employment and their attitudes with time-varying regional-level information from statistical offices on public early childhood education and care (ECEC) provision and information on gender care culture obtained from different waves of the European Values Study. We find that increasing the availability of ECEC is particularly effective in promoting women’s full-time employment and women’s labour market participation in contexts where traditional cultural values regarding gendered care prevail. The results appear to be independent of individual attitudes. The paper highlights the interaction between structural and cultural factors in shaping employment behaviour and suggests that the outcomes of social policy interventions, such as the expansion of ECEC, are strongly influenced by cultural contexts, although not necessarily in the expected direction.",Elisa Brini,BRNLSE88P62G843L

Thick filament mechanosensing is thought to control the number of motors switching ON in relation to the systolic performance, but its molecular basis is still controversial. Here, we use high spatial resolution X-ray diffraction data from electrically paced rat trabeculae and papillary muscles to provide a molecular explanation of the modulation of heart performance that calls for a revision of the mechanosensing hypothesis. We find that upon stimulation, titin-mediated structural changes in the thick filament switch motors ON throughout the filament within ~½ the maximum systolic force. These structural changes also drive Myosin Binding Protein-C (MyBP-C) to promote first motor attachments to actin from the central 1/3 of the half-thick filament. Progression of attachments toward the periphery of half-thick filament with increase in systolic force is carried on by near-neighbor cooperative thin filament activation by attached motors.

However, in coefficient plots that include several estimated coefficients, researchers often use confidence intervals to eyeball whether coefficients are statistically significant from each other, which results in an overly conservative test and increased risk of type II errors. To help avoid this eyeballing fallacy, we introduce the pheatplot postestimation command, which visualizes the statistical significance across estimates of categorical variables in a regression model. pheatplot efficiently compares the significance level between point estimates and helps researchers avoid making wrong assumptions about whether estimates differ. Moreover, by representing p -values as continuous measures rather than binary thresholds, it provides the flexibility to move beyond arbitrary cutoffs of statistical significance.

Different isoforms of the myosin motor in the skeletal muscles account for the different functional requirements of the slow muscles (primarily responsible for the posture) and fast muscles (responsible for voluntary movements). To clarify the molecular basis of the differences, here the isoform–dependent mechanokinetic parameters underpinning the force of slow and fast muscles are defined with a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure myosin isoforms from either slow or fast rabbit skeletal muscle. Data fitting with a stochastic model provides a self–consistent estimate of all the mechanokinetic properties of the motor ensemble including the motor force, the fraction of actin–attached motors and the rate of transition through the attachment–detachment cycle.

In particular, the paper explores to what extent previously existing inequalities in employment were further exacerbated during the pandemic. Using data from Italian Labor Force Surveys for the years 2018 to 2020, we find evidence of a limited decline of employment, but a strong increase of persons working zero hours during the lockdown periods. This result holds for both men and women. The pandemic highlighted how gender inequalities in employment intersect with other socio-economic disadvantages: single mothers and low-educated women were more affected than their male counterparts, while single and foreign men were hit stronger than women with the same characteristics. The pandemic thus came with differentiated consequences for groups of persons, generally affecting harder those already in less advantaged situations. At the same time, results support the idea that women’s employment was relevant to counteract job-loss in the family, and some became the only breadwinner for their families – also exposing themselves to risks by working during the pandemic. All in all, the pandemic greatly accentuated pre-existing social inequalities in the Italian labor market, yet with apparently transitory effect at least regarding employment participation. We discuss reasons of why this was the case.",Elisa Brini,BRNLSE88P62G843L

We first present a systematic review of studies regarding the impact of ECEC on fertility in high-income countries and then provide an empirical analysis for Italy, a country with lowest-low fertility rates and a welfare system that has traditionally provided limited support to families, especially through ECEC. We combine micro-level data from the Labour Force Survey for Italy from years 2003–2020 with information on regional indicators of public childcare and private childcare. The study employs within-region variation in ECEC over time to assess its effects on the transition to parenthood and parity progression for different groups of women and men. The present contribution indicates that both public and private childcare services have limited but positive short-term effects on fertility behaviour in Italy, contingent on specific socio-demographic groups. We discuss the possible reasons for the constrained effect of childcare on fertility and emphasise the necessity for more substantial and concerted interventions in Italy’s family policies if the aim is to invert demographic trends of lowest fertility and population-ageing.",Elisa Brini,BRNLSE88P62G843L

Based on data from the Italian Labour Force Survey, this paper examines the association between employment-related instability and the likelihood of having a first or additional child from 2000 to 2020 in Italy, covering a period characterised by increasing labour market deregulation. Our results show that individual employment instability, such as temporary employment or unemployment, negatively influences the likelihood of having a first and second child, while the progression to higher parities is less affected by employment situations. Building upon previous research, we demonstrate how the negative association between fertility and employment instability has intensified over recent decades, especially for women. The large sample size also allowed for the examination of specific differences by educational levels and both partners’ employment situation. In contrast to traditional views about gender roles, the employment situation of one’s partner seems to matter less for women than for men.",Elisa Brini,BRNLSE88P62G843L

First, we reproduce the paper's main findings and uncover one minor coding error and three estimates that have been reported with the opposite sign compared to that in our reproduction; neither is of consequence for the study's main results. Second, we test the robustness of the results by (1) recoding one of the main explanatory variables and several of the control variables to account for non-linear trends, (2) using alternative techniques to estimate clustered standard errors, (3) consistently applying a 95% confidence level in the presentation of the results, (4) altering the propensity score matching (PSM) procedure as well as the composition of the variables used in the PSM robustness check, (5) using an alternative technique to test for multicollinearity, (6) excluding potential endogenous control variables, and (7) using an alternative coding for computing margins. Reassuringly, the results are robust to most of these tests. However, two of the robustness checks challenge parts of the paper's main findings. First, allowing for non-linearity in the effect of time since the establishment of WPS shows (a) a non-linear effect on VAW and (b) no apparent changes in either male or female attitudes over time once the WPS has been established.

Probabilistic tumor maps were generated whereby binary tumor masks were aligned to a standard brain template and aggregated into compute voxel-wise frequency maps of glioma occurrence detailing glioma volume, molecular subtype, age, sex, and overall survival with tumor location. The study included 2164 patients with gliomas. Key findings include distinct spatial patterns associated with glioma size and molecular subtype: smaller tumors favored the left temporal region, medium-sized tumors the medial frontoparietal and bilateral temporal regions, and larger tumors the frontotemporoparietal regions, predominantly on the right. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) IDH wild-type tumors were more common in medial parietotemporal regions, while IDH-mutant tumors were preferentially found in frontotemporal regions. Younger patients had more frontal tumors, while older patients had higher parieto-occipital tumor burdens. Tumors in medial structures and parietal lobes were linked to lower survival whereas right temporal tumors were associated with higher rates of survival. These findings likely correlate with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status. Leveraging 8 glioma databases, probabilistic tumor maps revealed significant relationships between brain regions molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes.

Self-Determination Theory recently proposed a dual-process model, based on two distinct, yet related, constructs: Subjective Vitality, associated with well-being and positive health outcomes, and Subjective Depletion, associated with illbeing and negative emotions. Since, to date, no study has investigated vitality and depletion during adolescence, this study aims to validate the Subjective Vitality/Depletion Scale (SVDS) in a large sample of adolescents. Methods: A total of 1111 Italian adolescents (Mage = 14.49, SDage = 1.49; 48% females) completed the SVDS and other validated self-report measures. Specifically, the psychometric properties of the SVDS across biological sex and age groups and latent mean differences across these groups were assessed. Results: Findings supported the dimensionality of the SVDS with two correlated factors, and its construct validity through associations with positive and negative affect and basic psychological needs satisfaction. Full invariance for the SVDS was achieved across biological sex and age groups. Latent mean analyses indicated that males reported higher levels of vitality compared to females (Cohen’s d = 0.46), with no significant differences for depletion; older adolescents reported lower levels of vitality (d = −0.23) and higher levels of depletion (d = 0.20) compared to younger adolescents. Conclusions: These findings support the SVDS as a valid and reliable instrument for assessing energy-related experiences in adolescence. The results suggest meaningful sex differences and a potential developmental trend of declining subjective energy from early to later adolescence.",Fabio  Lucidi,LCDFBA65T01Z221G

MicroRNA‐22‐3p (miR‐22) regulates muscle differentiation and function. We assessed the diagnostic value of circulating miR‐22 levels in patients with primary and secondary sarcopenia. miR‐22 levels were evaluated in 61 older adults from the “Sarcopenia and Physical fRailty IN older people: multi‐componenT Treatment strategies” (SPRINTT) study and in 176 heart failure (HF) patients from the “Studies Investigating Co‐morbidities Aggravating HF” (SICA‐HF). miR‐22 expression profile was measured in serum by miR‐specific TaqMan quantitative real‐time PCR. In SPRINTT, 33 participants (54.1%) had primary sarcopenia. Subjects with primary sarcopenia had slower gait speed (0.7 [0.6–0.8] vs. 0.8 [0.7–1.0] m/s; p p = 0.004). In SICA‐HF, 28 patients (15.9%) had secondary sarcopenia. Sarcopenic HF patients were older (74.5 [68.7–80.2] vs. 68.4 [60.9–74.8] years; p = 0.001), had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (31.1 [26.2–47.5] vs. 40.0 [30.0–55.0] %; p = 0.025), lower handgrip strength (31.1 ± 6.0 vs. 37.0 ± 13.0 kg; p = 0.016) and lower absolute peak oxygen uptake (1181.3 ± 379.5 vs. 1593.0 ± 487.0 mL/min; p p = 0.020). miR‐22 levels are significantly associated with both primary and secondary sarcopenia, suggesting its potential as a novel epigenetic biomarker of skeletal muscle dysfunction.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study on octogenarians residing in the mountain community of the Sirente geographic area in Central Italy. Data collection was conducted from December 2023 to September 2024. Malnutrition was defined based on the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria. A panel of blood markers was examined, and principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify clusters of related molecules. Both unadjusted and adjusted binary logistic regression models were applied to investigate the associations between malnutrition and these molecular clusters. Results: Data from 196 older adults (mean age: 86.2 years) were analyzed. Malnutrition was positively associated with PC 2 (i.e., urea, c-terminal agrin fragment, and potassium) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.647, p-value: 0.039) and negatively associated with PC 3 (i.e., hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count) (OR = 0.567, p-value: 0.022) and PC 4 (i.e., calcium, albumin, total protein levels, and HDL cholesterol) (OR = 0.607, p-value: 0.035). Conclusions: Findings of the present study suggest that different clusters of blood markers are associated with malnutrition in older adults. Specifically, malnutrition is associated with clusters related to kidney function, anemia, neuromuscular function, and nutrient availability. These associations likely reflect the underlying biological mechanisms contributing to the development of malnutrition in this population.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B

We also examined the impact of the post-COVID-19 period on ideal CVH and identified demographic predictors of favorable cardiovascular risk profiles. Methods: Data for this cross-sectional study were collected between 2015 and 2024 as part of the Lookup 8+ project, an ongoing initiative integrating field-based CVH assessments across Italy. CVH was operationalized using a modified CVH score (0–7 points) inspired by Life’s Simple 7, combining behavioral and clinical metrics. Trends over time and across demographic groups were examined using descriptive statistics and multivariable models adjusted for age, sex, and year of assessment. Results: The study included 18,491 participants (mean age 56.1 ± 14.8 years; 55.2% women). After an initial decline in CVH score between 2015 and 2017 (mean score from 4.39 to 3.95), a gradual improvement followed, reaching 4.41 in 2024. Younger adults (18–39 years; 71.9% in 2024) and women (56.8%) consistently showed the highest prevalence of ideal CVH (score ≥ 5). The post-COVID-19 period was independently associated with higher odds of ideal CVH (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.24–1.40). While blood pressure and cholesterol metrics improved, dietary quality and glycemic control worsened over time. Conclusions: From 2015 to 2024, overall CVH improved among Lookup participants, particularly among younger individuals after the COVID-19 pandemic. However, substantial age- and sex-related gaps remain, requiring targeted and equity-oriented prevention efforts.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B

Interventions based on the combination of physical activity (PA) and nutritional counselling have been indicated as strategies for the management of this condition, although their effectiveness is not confirmed in all investigations. A possible explanation for this uncertain scenario relies in the impact of the adherence to PA interventions. Hence, the present study investigated the impact of the adherence to PA sessions on the incidence of mobility disability in older adults with PF&S. Methods This is a secondary analysis of an evaluator blinded, randomised controlled trial, developed in 16 clinical sites across 11 European countries, from January 2016 to 31 October 2019. Participants were community‐dwelling older adults (70+ years) with PF&S enrolled in the SPRINTT trial (NCT02582138). PF&S was operationalised as having a total score from 3 to 9 on the short physical performance battery (SPPB), low appendicular lean mass and ability to complete the 400‐m walk test in 3 sessions/week, AR). The primary outcome was incident mobility disability, operationalised as incident inability to complete the 400‐m walk test in Results Data of 1444 participants (mean age 79.3 years, 72.6% women) were analysed.

This demographic shift presents significant challenges and opportunities for public health, as urban environments exacerbate health disparities rooted in social determinants of health, such as economic stability, education, neighborhood conditions, and access to healthcare. Rapid urban growth, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, has led to the emergence of inequitable living conditions, environmental hazards, and limited access to essential health services, contributing to the early onset of multimorbidity and rising non-communicable disease burdens. Urbanization-driven factors such as obesogenic environments, sedentary lifestyles, air pollution, and inadequate sleep exacerbate cardiovascular and metabolic risks, while social exclusion, overcrowding, and inadequate mental health services heighten vulnerabilities. Emerging risks, including urban heat islands, noise pollution, and exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, further compound urban health inequities. Effective mitigation requires multi-sectoral policies that prioritize health-promoting infrastructure, reduce environmental pollutants, foster equitable healthcare access, and address systemic barriers affecting marginalized groups. This review explores the intersections between urbanization and health inequities, emphasizing the importance of addressing traditional and emerging risk factors across the lifespan. Policy implications include promoting green infrastructure, enhancing urban mobility, expanding mental health care, and leveraging participatory governance to foster resilient and inclusive cities. By adopting an integrated approach that prioritizes social equity and sustainability, cities can mitigate health disparities and create healthier, more inclusive urban environments that support the well-being of all residents.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B

Despite advancements in healthcare and living standards, the extension of lifespan has not been matched by an equivalent improvement in healthspan, leading to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities in older adults. This review examines strategies to promote healthy aging throughout the life cycle, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive strategy that integrates individual, healthcare, and environmental approaches. Individual strategies include lifestyle factors like diet, physical activity, and social connections. Healthcare approaches focus on improving health literacy, vaccinations, and screenings. Environmental approaches aim to mitigate climate change, reduce pollution, and design longevity-ready cities. A comprehensive strategy combining individual approaches, public health measures, innovative policies, and community support is essential for helping populations live longer, healthier, and more independent lives. Looking forward, this will be complemented by personalized approaches, focusing on individual traits and biological backgrounds. The key to this lies in geroscience, which studies the biological and molecular mechanisms of aging and how they contribute to age-related diseases and functional decline, aiming to design targeted interventions to slow aging and improve quality of life. Artificial intelligence will play a key role in analyzing these complex factors and creating innovative solutions. In conclusion, aging is shaped by various factors, requiring more than one solution.

Therefore, effective and accessible indicators are essential for early detection and prevention. This study investigates the link between the waist-to-calf circumference ratio (WCR) and diabetes risk in a large cohort from the Longevity Check-Up (Lookup) 8+ Study. The present investigation is a retrospective cross-sectional study. Diabetes was defined either as self-reported diagnosis, or fasting plasma glucose equal to or greater than 126 mg/dL, or random plasma glucose equal to or greater than 200 mg/dL. The WCR was calculated by dividing waist circumference by calf circumference. A total population of 8900 participants (mean age 57.1 ± 14.8 years, 55% women) was included in the study. The prevalence of diabetes was 9.4%. Mean WCR displayed a significant trend (p for trend < 0.001), and the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) revealed significant differences among the normal, pre-diabetes, diabetes groups. Unadjusted logistic regression showed a positive association between higher WCR and diabetes, which remained significant in the adjusted models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that WCR had a higher area under the curve compared to waist circumference alone, with cut-off values of 2.35 for men and 2.12 for women providing high sensitivity (91% for men, 92% for women) and specificity (74% for men, 75% for women).

Intrinsic capacity (IC) reflects functional reserve and is an indicator of healthy aging. Aims To explore the association between IC and recent falls (≤ 90 days) in community-dwelling octogenarians from the Aging and Longevity in the Sirente geographic area (IlSIRENTE) study. Methods The Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS−HC) and supplementary questionnaires and tests were used to assess the five IC domains: locomotion, cognition, vitality, psychology, and sensory. Scores in each domain were rescaled using the percent of maximum possible score method and averaged to obtain an overall IC score (range 0−100). Results The study included 319 participants (mean age 85.5 ± 4.8 years, 67.1% women). Mean IC score was 80.5 ± 14.2. The optimal IC score cut-off for predicting the two-year risk of incident loss of at least one activity of daily living (ADL) was determined and validated in a subset of 240 individuals without ADL disability at baseline (mean age 84.7 ± 4.4 years, 67.1% women). Participants were then stratified into low ( p p p = 0.003). When considering IC as a categorical variable, unadjusted logistic regression showed a strong association between high IC and lower odds of falls (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.16–0.60, p p p = 0.007). The locomotion domain was independently associated with falls in the unadjusted (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97–0.99, p p p Discussion This is the first study using an MDS−HC-derived instrument to assess IC. Individuals with higher IC were less likely to report recent falls, with locomotion being an independently associated domain. Conclusions Lower IC is linked to increased odds of falls. Interventions to maintain and improve IC, especially the locomotion domain, may reduce fall risk in community-dwelling octogenarians.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B

As a result, many older adults live with chronic illnesses, mobility limitations, and disabilities.3 Impaired mobility in old age is associated with increased health risks and mortality. However, how physical performance affects long-term survival in the oldest old is unclear. The present investigation explored the association between physical performance and up to 15-year survival in a cohort of community-dwelling octogenarians from the ""Aging and Longevity in the Sirente geographic area"" (ilSIRENTE) study. ilSIRENTE was a prospective cohort study designed by the Department of Geriatrics of the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore (Rome, Italy) and conducted in the Sirente area (L'Aquila, Italy) in collaboration with local authorities and healthcare professionals.4 From 429 eligible individuals born in the Sirente area before January 1, 1924 and present in the region during the initial survey, 65 opted not to participate, leaving 364 participants. Those ≥85 years at enrollment (n = 161) were excluded. Six individuals were removed due to unavailable survival information and two for missing physical performance data, leaving 195 participants for the current analysis. The Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS–HC)5 and additional questionnaires and tests from the InCHIANTI study6 were used for baseline assessments (December 2003–September 2004). Physical performance was evaluated through the short physical performance battery (SPPB),7 comprising balance tests, a 4-m gait speed test, and a chair-stand test. According to SPPB scores, functional impairment was categorized into severe (0–2), moderate (3–7), mild (8 or 9), or absent (10–12). Long-term survival was defined as reaching the age of 95. Vital status was confirmed by general practitioners and the National Death Registry. Participant characteristics were summarized using descriptive statistics according to survival categories. Continuous variables are presented as mean values ± standard deviation. Categorical variables are shown as absolute numbers and percentages. Between-group differences were assessed using unpaired t-tests and chi-squared statistics. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for long-term survival according to SPPB score and gait speed were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Kaplan–Meier curves were plotted to assess the impact of physical performance on 10-year survival, with comparisons made using the log-rank test and Holm adjustment method for pairwise comparisons. Analyses were conducted using R version 4.2.3. Participant characteristics according to survival categories are listed in Table 1. Mean age at enrollment was 82.3 ± 1.4 years and 131 (67.2%) were women. Forty-five (21.1%) participants reached 95 years, while 150 (79.9%) died before 95 years. Long-term survivors were predominantly women, had lower levels of disability, and higher body mass index (BMI), SPPB scores and gait speed. No long-term survivor had heart failure, compared with 13 (8.7%) of those who died earlier. Long-term survivors took fewer medications, without difference in the frequency of polypharmacy, and had lower plasma interleukin 6 (IL6) levels. A greater percentage of patients who died earlier had severe functional impairment, while the long-term survivors had higher a proportion of robust individuals. Cox regression showed that a higher SPPB score and gait speed were independently associated with lower HRs of dying before 95 years (Figure 1A,B). Female sex, higher BMI, and lower plasma IL6 levels were further significant predictors of long-term survival. Ten-year mortality differed significantly according to physical performance (p < 0.001; Figure 1C). Pairwise comparison showed significant differences between all categories and SPPB 0–2 (p < 0.001 vs. SPPB 10–12 and 8–9; p = 0.011 vs. SPPB 3–7) and between SPPB 3–7 and 10–12 (p = 0.011). The present analysis indicates that physical performance is independently associated with long-term survival in very old adults living in the community. Consistent with literature,7 physical performance is as a reliable metric for assessing mortality risk in octogenarians. Neither the number of diseases nor any specific disease predicted long-term survival. Our findings, together with available evidence,3, 8-10 support the view that physical performance is a primary target for interventions to enhance longevity and extend health span.

By conceptualising a brain space as a space whose points are connectome configurations representing brain functional states, changes in brain network functionality can be represented by paths between these points. Paths from a healthy state to a diseased one, or between diseased states as instances of disease progression, are modelled as the action of the Krankheit-Operator , that produces changes from a brain functional state to another one.

The evaluation of the K-operator is conducted across different stages, from cognitive normal (CN) to Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD. Furthermore, by adopting a machine learning-based approach, we also explore the potential use of the K-operator as a diagnostic tool for predicting AD progression by starting from rs-fMRI at the initial visit.

They can be formalized as the action of an operator representing the disease, the so-called K -operator, acting on the network. The healing process can thus be seen as the inverse of the disease mechanism. However, perfect healing is often impossible to achieve. Here, we formalize the ideal healing in terms of perturbative variation of the possible partial healing. The modeling and analytical strategy is based on techniques from theoretical physics, with the language of matrix operators. In addition, using the language of category theory, we also formalize the progressive abstraction from the reality of diseased patients to the definition of a disease and the comparison between different diseases as a natural transformation between colimits. This theoretical presentation can provide a new, interdisciplinary perspective on neurological investigation and possibly foster new theoretical-experimental developments.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D

Clinically, there are three stages of cognitive decline: dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline (self-reported cognitive issues). Both MCI and subjective cognitive decline are recognized as risk factors for dementia, but most countries do not recommend specific treatments outside of clinical trials. Identifying preventive indicators of AD is critical for developing effective disease control strategies. The diagnosis of MCI or dementia is typically made by a clinician through detailed neuropsychological and neurological assessments, basic lab tests, and structural brain imaging (MRI or CT scans). Additional diagnostic methods may include biomarkers from PET brain scans or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since CSF collection requires lumbar punctures, finding less invasive blood-based biomarkers is crucial. A key goal of precision medicine, though highly challenging, is to improve the classification of pathological conditions based on molecular markers rather than relying solely on clinical symptoms. From this perspective, providing a clear and objective identification of conditions that could progress into more severe symptoms while distinguishing them from other types of impairments is crucial for improving early detection of AD. A clustering-based molecular stratification of MCI patients by analyzing transcriptomic data from blood samples provided by the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) resource is realized with this aim. A specific AI-based pipeline is built to perform the transcriptomic analysis, integrating unsupervised and supervised learning approaches. Starting with feature selection techniques, the pipeline uses deep learning-based autoencoders to embed gene expression data from 381 patients into a lower-dimensional latent space. This latent representation is then fed into a clustering algorithm to determine the final result. The identified MCI patient clusters show significant molecular, clinical, and pathophysiological differences. Differences are also evident between some MCI patient clusters compared to patients with AD diagnosis, as well as with control samples. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a molecular-based stratification of MCI patients using blood transcriptomic data. These findings can lead to an early and precise diagnosis of dementia and related conditions, offering a more objective alternative to standard cognitive-based definitions often influenced by subjective interpretation.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D

Neurological diseases are often related to malfunctions in this network. We propose a conceptual model of the brain, describing the disease as the result of an operator affecting and disrupting the network organization. We adopt the formalism of operators, matrices, and tensor products adapted from theoretical physics. This novel approach can be tested and instantiated for different diseases, balancing mathematical formalism and data-driven findings, including pathologies where aging is included as a risk factor. We quantitatively model the K -operator from real data of Parkinson’s Disease, from the Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) upon concession by the University of Southern California. The networks are reconstructed from fMRI analysis, resulting in a matrix acting on the healthy brain and giving as output the diseased brain. We finally decompose the K -operator into the tensor product of its submatrices and we are able to assess its action on each region of interest (ROI) characterizing the brain for the specific considered samples. We also approximate the time-dependent K -operator from the fMRI of the same patient at the baseline and at the first follow-up. Our results confirm the findings of the literature on the topic. Also, these applications confirm the feasibility of the proposed analytic technique. Further research developments can compare operators for different patients and for different diseases, looking for commonalities and aiming to develop a comprehensive theoretical approach.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D

A possible explanation for these divergent results is that investigations have not adequately adjusted their analyses according to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Therefore, the present study examined the cross-sectional associations between hypertension-related parameters, ACEI use, and cognitive function, mood, and behavioral symptoms in very old adults. Methods This study was conducted by analyzing the IlSIRENTE database, a prospective cohort study that collected data on all individuals aged 80 years and older residing in the Sirente geographic area ( n = 364). Blood pressure (BP) was assessed after 20 to 40 min of rest, while participants sat in an upright position. Drugs were coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical codes. Cognitive function, mood, and behavioral symptoms were recorded using the Minimum Data Set Home Care instrument. Blood inflammatory markers were measured. Results Hypertension-related parameters were significantly associated with many cognitive, mood, and behavioral parameters after adjustment for covariates. However, only the inverse association between hypertension and lesser problems with short-term memory remained significant. Participants with hypertension had lower blood concentrations of inflammatory markers in comparison to their normotensive peers. Conclusion Findings from the present study indicate that high BP values are associated with fewer complaints about memory problems in very old adults. Furthermore, a lower concentration of inflammatory markers was found in hypertensive participants. ACEI use might affect this scenario.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B

However, it is unclear which physical capabilities should be prioritized to obtain prognostic information in older adults. Aims To examine the associations between the performance on several physical function tests and falls, disability, and death in a well-characterized sample of very old Italian adults. Methods This was a prospective cohort study of older adults who lived in the mountain community of the Sirente geographic area in Central Italy. Physical performance was assessed using isometric handgrip strength (IHG), walking speed (WS) at a usual and fast pace, 5-time sit-to-stand test (5STS), and sit-to-stand power measures. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass was estimated from calf circumference using a validated equation. History of falls, incident falls, and disability status according to basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) were recorded over two years. Survival status was obtained from the participants’ general practitioners and was confirmed by the National Death Registry over 10 years from enrolment. Linear, binary, and Cox regressions were performed to evaluate the association between physical performance measures and health outcomes. Results The mean age of the 255 participants was 84.2 ± 5.1 years, and 161 (63.1%) were women. Logistic regression indicated that IHG was significantly associated with incident ADL disability, whereas specific sit-to-stand muscle power was an independent predictor of death. No significant associations were observed between physical function and falls.

Indeed, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 had identified muscle mass as the key component to confirm the diagnosis of sarcopenia. However, the lack of normative values for muscle mass across ages hampers the practical assessment of this important parameter. The aim of the present study was to produce cross‐sectional centile and normative values for calf circumference (a surrogate estimation of muscle mass) across a wide spectrum of ages using a large and unselected sample of community‐dwellers enrolled in the Longevity Check‐up 7+ (Lookup 7+) project. Methods This is a cross‐sectional study using the data of Lookup 7+ project, an ongoing study started in June 2015 and conducted in unconventional settings (i.e., exhibitions, malls, and health promotion campaigns). Candidate participants were considered eligible for enrolment if they were at least 45 years of age and provided written informed consent. Calf circumference was measured using an inextensible but flexible plastic tape in a sitting position with the knee and ankle at a right angle and the feet resting on the floor.

The effects of combined aerobic training (AT) and high protein intake (HPI) on cardiometabolic parameters in older adults are not well established. Aims To investigate the association of AT and HPI with blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, and total blood cholesterol levels in a sample of Italian older adults enrolled in the Longevity Check-up 7 + (Lookup 7 +) study. Methods Lookup 7 + is an ongoing project started in June 2015 and conducted in unconventional settings (e.g., exhibitions, malls, health promotion campaigns) across Italy with the aim of fostering adoption of healthy lifestyles in the general population. For the present investigation, analyses were conducted in participants 65 + years and with body mass index values ≥ 18.5 kg/m 2 (n = 3219). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP), blood glucose, and total blood cholesterol were measured. Protein intake was estimated using a 12-item food frequency questionnaire. HPI was operationalized as a daily protein intake ≥ 0.8 g/kg of body weight. AT was operationalized as the practice of running and/or swimming for 60 + minutes at least twice weekly during the previous year. Results The mean age of the 3219 participants was 72.7 ± 5.7 years, and 55.2% were women. Adherence to AT combined with a HPI was negatively and independently associated with SPB (β: − 4.976; 95% confidence interval: − 9.8 to − 0.08). No other significant associations were observed. Discussion and conclusions Our results indicate that AT combined with HPI was negatively associated with SBP in a large and relatively unselected sample of Italian older adults living in the community.

A primary advantage of NMR is its capacity for the direct analysis of complex matrices, such as synthetic libraries and crude natural extracts, obviating the need for extensive chromatographic fractionation and thereby enabling the direct identification of bioactive constituents. This perspective provides a comprehensive review of ligand-observed NMR methodologies based on the principle that molecular binding is a prerequisite for biological function. Key techniques are systematically described, including Saturation Transfer Difference (STD), Transferred-NOE SpectroscopY (trNOESY), and methods based on relaxation rates (e.g., <i>T</i> <sub>2</sub>-relaxation filtering using CPMG pulse sequences). Further approaches include Diffusion Ordered SpectroscopY (DOSY), WaterLOGSY, and <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectroscopy, a highly sensitive modality for screening fluorinated compound libraries. Collectively, these techniques facilitate the rapid identification of binding hits and provide critical insights into the structural and dynamic features of ligand-receptor interactions, including binding epitopes and bound-state conformations. The paper envisages future perspectives, emphasizing the potential of hyperpolarization methods to overcome the sensitivity limitations of benchtop instruments and the growing importance of in-cell and on-cell NMR applications for investigating molecular interactions within a native physiological context, which constitutes a significant frontier in drug discovery.",Cristina  Airoldi,RLDCST79B53A794C

The present study explores the association between HRVand exhaustion—the core symptomof burnout. Based on the multilevel model of employee well-being, we hypothesize that neuroticism moderates the relationship between HRV and exhaustion.We collected data among 271 workers (57.92% women, mean age M = 41.21 years, SD = 13.94), whose HRV was measured over the course of one working day, while exhaustion was measured at the end of the same working day. Neuroticism and covariates were measured at baseline, prior to the examined working day. Results from multiple linear regression models revealed that HRV was negatively related to exhaustion, even after controlling for exhaustion measured at baseline. In addition, as hypothesized, trait neuroticism moderated the negative association between HRV and exhaustion at the end of the working day such that it was stronger for workers high (i.e., +1 SD) versus low (i.e., −1 SD) in neuroticism. The test for constant variance pointed to high-neuroticism workers with low HRV as the group more at-risk of developing exhaustion-related symptoms.

The quality and the trustworthiness of these datasets, however, can sometimes be poor, producing bad results in turn, which can harm patients and data subjects. To address this problem, policy-makers, researchers, and consortia have proposed diverse regulations, guidelines, and scores to assess the quality and increase the reliability of datasets. Although generally useful, however, they are often incomplete and impractical. The guidelines of Datasheets for Datasets , in particular, are too numerous; the requirements of the Kaggle Dataset Usability Score focus on non-scientific requisites (for example, including a cover image); and the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) sets forth sparse and general data governance requirements, which we tailored to datasets for biomedical AI. Against this backdrop, we introduce our new Venus score to assess the data quality and trustworthiness of biomedical datasets. Our score ranges from 0 to 10 and consists of ten questions that anyone developing a bioinformatics, medical informatics, or cheminformatics dataset should answer before the release. In this study, we first describe the EU AI Act , Datasheets for Datasets , and the Kaggle Dataset Usability Score , presenting their requirements and their drawbacks. To do so, we reverse-engineer the weights of the influential Kaggle Score for the first time and report them in this study. We distill the most important data governance requirements into ten questions tailored to the biomedical domain, comprising the Venus score. We apply the Venus score to twelve datasets from multiple subdomains, including electronic health records, medical imaging, microarray and bulk RNA-seq gene expression, cheminformatics, physiologic electrogram signals, and medical text. Analyzing the results, we surface fine-grained strengths and weaknesses of popular datasets, as well as aggregate trends. Most notably, we find a widespread tendency to gloss over sources of data inaccuracy and noise, which may hinder the reliable exploitation of data and, consequently, research results. Overall, our results confirm the applicability and utility of the Venus score to assess the trustworthiness of biomedical data.",Davide Chicco,CHCDVD84R18D969F

This study assessed brain white matter (WM) and grey-matter (GM) microstructure in FTD variants using neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) diffusion MRI model and developed an exploratory machine-learning algorithm to classify FTD subtypes according to diffusion MRI metrics. Brain MRI including multi-shell diffusion sequences and neuropsychological assessment were obtained in controls and participants with FTD: 35 behavioural variant of FTD (bvFTD), 20 semantic-variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 14 nonfluent-variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA), 9 semantic-bvFTD (sbvFTD). Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), intracellular-volume fraction (ICVF), and orientation-dispersion index (ODI) were analysed using tract-based and GM-based spatial statistic at the voxel-wise level, with nonparametric and permutation-based methods. Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained on different combinations of diffusion MRI and neuropsychological features to classify FTD subtypes. FA and MD showed widespread WM alterations in all variants. ICVF showed reductions in both WM and GM (bilateral frontotemporal for bvFTD, left temporal-frontal for svPPA and nfvPPA and right temporal for sbvFTD). GM ODI reduction exhibited a similar but more diffuse pattern compared with ICVF. WM ODI alterations were also observed, with specific WM alterations in the corpus callosum and long-range WM tracts when comparing FTD syndromes. SVM algorithm, trained on mean FA, ICVF and ODI values from different brain lobes and neuropsychological scores, achieved 98.6% accuracy in classifying different clinical syndromes, outperforming standard diffusion tensor (DT) imaging-based models. NODDI capture subtle microstructural alterations in brain GM and WM, demonstrating advantages over standard DT imaging in capturing disease-relevant alterations. By integrating NODDI with cognitive data, machine-learning models can learn complex patterns and relationships facilitating the differentiation of FTD subtypes.",Edoardo Gioele Spinelli,SPNDDG87T19F205S

Although insufficiently investigated, their distinction holds important clinical relevance for accurate diagnosis of ALS with behavioural impairment and for patients’ prognosis and management. In the present study, we aimed to assess both apathy and depressive symptoms in patients with ALS and whether they have similar or different functional neural correlates. Methods Using graph analysis and connectomics, global and lobar nodal properties and regional functional brain connectivity were assessed in ALS patients without apathy/depression (ALSn, n = 42), with apathy without depression (ALSa, n = 14), with depressive symptoms without apathy (ALSd, n = 20), and with apathy and depressive symptoms (ALSad, n = 6), and 46 healthy controls. Correlations between brain functional properties, apathy and depressive symptoms were performed in all patients. Results Depressive symptoms were related with reduced path length within bilateral basal ganglia (BG) network, and apathy was related with increased path length, decreased nodal strength and local efficiency within left BG network. ALSa patients showed altered functional nodal properties within BG network compared to ALSn and ALSd. Compared to healthy controls and all non-apathetic patients (ALSn and ALSd), all apathetic patients (ALSa and ALSad) exhibited altered functional nodal properties within parietal, occipital and frontal networks. Non-apathetic patients, compared to apathetic patients, showed relatively preserved functional nodal properties in the BG network. Conclusions Our findings indicate differences in brain functional neural organization associated with apathy and depression, underscoring the importance of distinguishing these symptoms in ALS and highlighting the need for targeted interventions.",Edoardo Gioele Spinelli,SPNDDG87T19F205S

In this study, we examined the relationship between network vulnerability and longitudinal progression of atrophy in FTD patients, using the network diffusion model (NDM) of the spread of pathology. Thirty behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD), 13 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 14 non-fluent variant primary progressive aphasia (nfvPPA) and 12 semantic behavioural variant FTD (sbvFTD) patients underwent longitudinal T1-weighted MRI. Fifty young controls (20–31 years of age) underwent multi-shell diffusion MRI scan. An NDM was developed to model progression of FTD pathology as a spreading process from a seed through the healthy structural connectome, using connectivity measures from fractional anisotropy and intracellular volume fraction in young controls. Four disease epicentres were initially identified from the peaks of atrophy of each FTD variant: left insula (bvFTD), left temporal pole (svPPA), right temporal pole (sbvFTD) and left supplementary motor area (nfvPPA). Pearson’s correlations were calculated between NDM-predicted atrophy in young controls and the observed longitudinal atrophy in FTD patients over a follow-up period of 24 months. The NDM was then run for all 220 brain seeds to verify whether the four epicentres were among those that yielded the highest correlation. Using the NDM, predictive maps in young controls showed progression of pathology from the peaks of atrophy in svPPA, nfvPPA and sbvFTD over 24 months. svPPA exhibited early involvement of the left temporal and occipital lobes, progressing to extensive left hemisphere impairment. nfvPPA and sbvFTD spread in a similar manner bilaterally to frontal, sensorimotor and temporal regions, with sbvFTD additionally affecting the right hemisphere. Moreover, the NDM-predicted atrophy of each region was positively correlated with longitudinal real atrophy, with a greater effect in svPPA and sbvFTD. In bvFTD, the model starting from the left insula (the peak of atrophy) demonstrated a highly left-lateralized pattern, with pathology spreading to frontal, sensorimotor, temporal and basal ganglia regions, with minimal extension to the contralateral hemisphere by 24 months. However, unlike the atrophy peaks observed in the other three phenotypes, the left insula did not show the strongest correlation between the estimated and real atrophy. Instead, the bilateral superior frontal gyrus emerged as optimal seeds for modelling atrophy spread, showing the highest correlation ranking in both hemispheres. Overall, NDM applied on the intracellular volume fraction connectome yielded higher correlations relative to NDM applied on fractional anisotropy maps. The NDM implementation using the cross-sectional structural connectome is a valuable tool to predict patterns of atrophy and spreading of pathology in FTD clinical variants.",Edoardo Gioele Spinelli,SPNDDG87T19F205S

In this position article, we advance the notion of “positive demography,” which—while acknowledging existing challenges—contends that since a new demographic phase is inevitable, high-income countries should focus on making the most of it. We discuss this view with reference to Italy, one of the fastest-aging countries in the world, drawing lessons from Spoke 1 (The Demography of Aging) of the Age-It Research Program. Methods We integrate different perspectives from social research on aging, informed by the most up-to-date literature in demography. This approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of demographic changes, highlighting their benefits while proposing forward-looking policy solutions. Results Longer life expectancy and improved health outcomes create opportunities for extended workforce participation and intergenerational contributions. Bridging the gap between desired and actual fertility is feasible through structural policies. Migration, at least in the short term, offers a means to mitigate aging-related challenges and accelerate demographic renewal. Discussion A positive demography agenda extends beyond addressing aging-related needs; it requires investments in younger generations to help them prepare for long and fulfilling lives. Achieving this vision necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration, innovation in data collection, and a methodological shift from forecasting to backcasting—identifying present actions necessary to shape a desirable demographic future.",Gustavo De Santis,DSNGTV60M31L219E

The questionnaire collected information about the organization profile, the target population, and the educational activity. For qualitative data, semi-structured interviews were conducted with staff coordinators and managers. Results Forty-three organizations, mostly Italian non-governmental organizations (NGOs), reported on 50 “promising practices” with a wide range of aims, consistent with the definition of lifelong and lifewide learning: social inclusion, health promotion, caregivers support, social work and volunteering, digital literacy, and intergenerational activities.

In the theoretical part of this article, we elucidate a potential fallacy in the line of reasoning based on simulations and counterfactuals frequently used to attribute population aging to low fertility rates. The alternative view that we propose leads us to hypothesize that age structures conform, albeit not exclusively, to a standard derived from survival conditions: the age structure of a stationary population within a given period. We tested this hypothesis on all countries, using the data from the United Nations database (1951 &ndash; 2021) and specifically on 10 European countries using the data from the Human Mortality Database (1860 &ndash; 2019). The empirical results indicate that current survival conditions sufficiently explain a significant portion of the observed age structure across all examined countries and epochs. However, deviations from this underlying, long-term (mortality-driven) path exist, which our approach cannot fully explain. This is where the role of fertility arguably becomes more prominent. Several implications arise from our findings, including the debate on the relative role of fertility and mortality in shaping age structures in the long run, the theoretical meaning and practical use of cross-sectional life tables, and the notion and measure of demographic dividends.",Gustavo De Santis,DSNGTV60M31L219E

Methods Age-It adopts a life course perspective encompassing individual, family, and societal levels. It conceptualizes “aging well” as the outcome of multi-agent, multi-context processes unfolding from early life through old age. Furthermore, Age-It moves beyond a multidisciplinary approach by fostering true cross-fertilization between biomedical, sociodemographic, and technological sciences. Structured as an umbrella initiative, the program brings together multiple interlinked projects that address diverse dimensions of aging through transdisciplinary and collaborative research. Results The program addresses key limitations in Italy’s current aging research and policy landscape: fragmented data, disciplinary silos, and weak connections between research and policymaking.

Methods An online anonymous survey was distributed via the mailing list of the European Geriatric Medicine Society (EuGMS), national member groups and the authors’ professional networks, targeting geriatricians, or trainees in their final 2 years of specialist geriatric training, working in a hospital, rehabilitation, post-acute care or residential setting in a European country. Quantitative data were summarized using descriptive statistics and frequency distributions. Inductive content analysis was used to interpret open-text questions. Results The 240 respondents were predominantly female (63%), with a 6:1 consultant to trainee ratio and marked underrepresentation of Eastern Europe. Integrated care pathways (current or in-development) for delirium, dementia, or frailty are reported in 48–78% of settings. Dementia and delirium pathways are common except in radiology, neurosurgery, and operating/recovery settings. Frailty pathways are less common overall, and specific frailty staff are less common than dementia or delirium staff. Dementia pathways commonly incorporate delirium screening (76%) and prevention (73%), but less commonly frailty screening (61%). Similarly, delirium pathways often provide guidance on formal dementia diagnosis (62%) but less than half incorporate frailty screening/assessment (46%). Notably, only 19% of delirium pathways differentiate between managing delirium and delirium-superimposed-on-dementia (DSD). Frailty pathways frequently incorporate cognitive assessment (81%) and delirium screening/assessment (75%), but only 57% incorporate delirium prevention. Conclusion Dementia and delirium pathways are more common and more integrated and inclusive of each other than frailty pathways. More unified approaches could maximize the value of staff time, reduce duplications, and avoid a siloed approach to the care of older people.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

Aims To test the predictive accuracy of different frailty measures, blood routine tests and MDR infection status for in-hospital mortality among older patients with sepsis. Methods Consecutive patients aged ≥ 65 years with qSOFA ≥ 2 and positive cultures admitted to a tertiary care hospital were enrolled. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), the Primary Care–Frailty Index (PC-FI), and a 50-item FI. A base logistic regression model including age, sex, WBC count, platelets, creatinine, hs-CRP, and lactate predicted mortality. Frailty indices and MDR status were sequentially added, and model performance was compared using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC). A nomogram was developed to visualize mortality probabilities. Results Among 93 patients (median age 80, IQR [72–84] years, 63.4% males), in-hospital mortality was 16.1%. Deceased patients were frailer and had a higher number of comorbidities. By logistic multivariable regression, the base model achieved an AUROC of 0.771 for predicting in-hospital mortality.

While recent diabetes guidelines introduce the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) as a key tool for managing diabetes treatments, evidence of its effectiveness in delaying functional impairment and achieving patient-reported outcomes (PROs) remains lacking. This article describes the protocol of a randomized parallel-group controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effect of a CGA-guided plan of care on physical performance changes over time as compared with a usual-care group. Methods Three centers will participate in this study, each recruiting 60 older adults with T2DM from their outpatient clinics. Eligible patients will be randomized into either the usual-care or intervention group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. All patients will receive standard care according to current diabetes guidelines and undergo CGA. For the intervention group, the CGA will guide a multidimensional intervention. Follow-up visits will be scheduled at 6 and 12 months. The primary outcome will be the change in physical performance at the end of the follow-up, as assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery score, with a comparison between the control and intervention groups. Discussion From this study, we will contribute to the growing evidence of the impact of CGA on the assessment and management of older patients with T2DM and its complications. Results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal and presentations at conferences. Final results will be shared with a broader audience through collaborations with patients with diabetes and their caregiver association at local and national levels.

However, the impact of continuing versus deprescribing BZDs during hospitalization on short-term mortality after discharge remains uncertain. This study aims to evaluate the association of BZD-use at hospital discharge with 6-month mortality and explore whether in-hospital deprescribing modifies mortality risk. Methods This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from patients (aged 66–101 years) consecutively admitted to an Acute Geriatric Unit (AGU). Upon admission, all patients underwent a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), including functional status, comorbidities, and medications review. A multivariable Cox-regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between 6-month mortality and BZD prescription at hospital discharge (BZD non-users, BZD at discharge, and BZD deprescribed). Results Overall, 1375 patients (median age: 85.5 [IQR: 48-77, 55% females]) were included. Following therapeutic reconciliation, the BZD at discharge group was younger (p = 0.029), had lower frailty (p = 0.031), cognitive decline (p = 0.043) and in-hospital delirium (p &lt; 0.001) prevalence than the BZD non-users and BZD deprescribed groups. The BZD at discharge group (n = 130) showed a higher risk of all-cause 6-month mortality compared to BZD non-users (n = 1066) (HR: 1.64; 95%CI: 1.14-2.37). Conversely, patients in whom BZDs were deprescribed during hospitalization (n = 179) exhibited a similar mortality risk as non-users (HR: 0.97; 95%CI: 0.68–1.39). Conclusions BZDs prescription on hospital discharge was associated with an increased risk of 6-month mortality, whereas deprescription may mitigate this excess risk.

This study aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of delirium in patients admitted to an acute geriatric unit (AGU) with AHF, to describe its subtypes, and to assess their impact on 90-day post-discharge survival. METHODS This prospective observational study included older adults hospitalised for AHF in an AGU between April 2022 and November 2024. Delirium was assessed using the 4AT and DSM-5 criteria and categorised as prevalent (on admission) or incident (during hospitalisation). Psychomotor delirium subtypes were classified as hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed. Sociodemographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Ninety-day survival was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. RESULTS Among 399 patients (median age 87.4 years, 52% female), 132 (33%) experienced delirium, with 13.8% classified as prevalent and 19.2% as incident cases. Among those with delirium, 48% presented with the hyperactive, 31% with hypoactive, and 21% with the mixed subtype. In multivariable regression analysis, adjusted for relevant covariates, the hypoactive (adjusted HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.13–3.64) and mixed (adjusted HR 2.28, 95% CI 1.18–4.43) subtypes –but not hyperactive–were independently associated with an increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS Delirium is common in very old patients hospitalised for AHF.

Phlorizin (phloretin-2-’O-β-glucopyranoside) is an O-glucoside of phloretin, a member of the dihydrochalcone family that is, in turn, a subclass of flavonoids. Isolated from the bark of the apple tree was initially used for its antipyretic and antimalarial effect. Many years later von Mering discovered its glycosuric properties. SGLT2i, originally developed as oral hypoglycemic agents, have emerged as particularly valuable therapeutic options for older adults due to their efficacy and favourable safety profile, enabling glycaemic control without necessitating aggressive intervention strategies. Contemporary evidence demonstrates that SGLT2i maintains remarkable glycaemic efficacy across age stratifications, dispelling earlier concerns regarding diminished therapeutic response in older populations. The mechanism of action of SGLT2i, which involves inhibition of glucose reabsorption in the proximal renal tubules, remains functionally intact despite age-related physiological changes, including modest reductions in glomerular filtration rate commonly observed in geriatric patients. In this review the use of sglt2i in older patients will be analysed in detail.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

Objectives: This study investigated sex-related differences in the CSF/blood quotient of albumin (QAlb), a BCSFB function biomarker, in older patients undergoing spinal anesthesia for hip fracture (HF) surgery. Design: Seventy-eight patients aged ⩾65 years (18 males, 60 females) undergoing HF repair were enrolled. Methods: Baseline variables, including age, sex, diagnosis of dementia, were collected. The BCSFB function was assessed using the CSF/blood quotient of albumin (QAlb). Results: Dementia prevalence was similar in men (22.2%) and women (17.6%), as was postoperative delirium (POD) (men 27.8%, women 33.3%). Despite similar demographics, men exhibited significantly higher CSF albumin concentrations ( P = .031) and QAlb values ( P = .023) compared to women. No differences were found in QAlb value between patients with or without dementia in male ( P = .645) and female ( P = .102) subgroups. Moreover, no differences in QAlb value emerged between those with or without POD in males ( P = .173) and females ( P = .225). Conclusion: Despite sample size and sex imbalance, our analyses highlight a sex-related discrepancy in BCSFB function in older patients underscoring the need for sex-specific QAlb reference ranges.

In 2023, our group and researchers from around the world conducted a global one-day point prevalence study of delirium on WDAD. These strategies appear to improve delirium recognition and management. Objective To assess participants’ perceived impact of participating in the WDAD 2023 one-day point prevalence study and to gather feedback on the survey process to inform future campaigns. Methods An online survey was administered to multiple national and clinical collaborators from 44 countries participating in the one-day global point delirium prevalence study on WDAD 2023. Using SurveyMonkey®, the survey was distributed via a snowball system, with participants’ consent implied through their involvement. The survey, developed iteratively to balance time and detail, consisted of six core questions, including closed and open formats. Data were collected from September 9th to October 9th, 2023, and qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed using Excel®. Quantitative data underwent statistical analysis using IBM® SPSS Statistics28. Results 49 out of 53 (93.45%) healthcare professionals responded to the survey: 71.43% reported increased awareness, and responses were almost equally divided between those who initiated projects (46.94%) and those who did not (53.06%). Most participants (93.88%) did not find the WDAD 2023 one-day point prevalence study in March burdensome, and all expressed interest in future participation. The WDAD 2023 one-day point prevalence study highlighted diverse projects, primarily focused on delirium awareness and education. The survey found suggestions for future improvements emphasizing more efficient, digital, and engaging research methods and a clear need for educational resources, particularly in ICU delirium. Conclusions Our survey finds that participation in WDAD 2023 one-day point prevalence study boosted delirium visibility, leading to ongoing awareness, interest in future studies, and practice changes that benefit patients and the healthcare system. Further evidence-based research is needed to assess the impact of these campaigns on delirium recognition and management.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

We aimed to validate the electronic–Regional Healthcare Database Frailty Index (e–RHD–FI) in the general adult population, describe its distribution by sex and age, evaluate its predictive validity for mortality and hospitalization, and assess the performance of frailty cut–off points. Methods We conducted a population–based study of 8,404,004 adult beneficiaries of the Lombardy Regional Health System. The e–RHD–FI was calculated from 40 health deficits using electronic health records from 2008–2018. We assessed its distribution, predictive validity for 1–year mortality and hospitalizations through multi–state analysis and multivariable models evaluating performance across subgroups. Results The e–RHD–FI distribution was highly asymmetrical (median 0.0125, first–third quartiles 0–0.0375), with 45.8% of adults having no deficits. The index was higher in older adults. Each 0.1–point increment in e–RHD–FI was associated with doubled 1–year mortality risk (HR: 2.12, 99%CI: 2.11–2.14) and 2.5–fold increased hospitalization rate (IRR: 2.51, 99%CI: 2.49–2.53). The AUC for 1–year mortality was 0.883 (99%CI: 0.881–0.884).

Methods This retrospective study was based on AHDs of the Lombardy region, Italy (from 1st January 2020 to 31st December 2023). Cox regression models, both crude and adjusted, were applied to estimate the association between treatments and outcomes [CVEs, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), and thromboembolic events (TEs)]. We tested the interaction between the drug treatment and the regulatory agency prescription rule changes [before or after 06th July 2021, the date of the first European Medicine Association (EMA) pronouncement on tofacitinib safety] or patient profiles. Results We identified 7,541 therapeutic courses in 5,563 patients: 2,343 started as TNFi users, 1,443 as JAKi users, and 1,777 started with other drugs (1,459 days of follow-up). The crude incidence rates (IRs) for new CVEs were 16.6 [95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 12.8–21.2] and 18.6 (95% CI: 14.2–23.9) per 1,000 person-years (PYs) for TNFi and JAKi users, respectively. Exposure to JAKis was not associated with a significantly increased risk of CVEs [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.92; 95% CI: 0.64–1.32], MACEs (adjusted HR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.37–1.33), or TEs (adjusted HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 0.65–3.65) compared to TNFis. Each 0.1-point increment of the FI significantly increased the HR for new CVEs (HR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.48–2.19), MACEs (HR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.10–2.51), and TEs (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.03–2.78). When assessing the interaction between the period of drug delivery and the treatment with JAKis on the risk of new CVEs, no significant interaction was observed (p = 0.838), while the interaction was statistically significant for baseline CV risk (p = 0.007). Conclusion RA patients treated with JAKis in real-world settings have a risk of developing CVEs no higher than those of TNFi users, but potential signals remain for TEs, even if the sample was not sufficiently powered. Patient profiles, particularly the frailty, have a more substantial impact on the risk of CVEs than the specific disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) choice.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

However, few studies have assessed post-surgery functional and cognitive outcomes in this demographic. This study aims to characterize baseline cognitive and functional status of patients undergoing elective cardiothoracic surgery (CS) and to evaluate their modifications over a 3-month follow-up. Methods: Data were extracted from a prospective study starting May 2023. Patients aged 65+ undergoing elective CS received pre-operative geriatric assessments. Postoperative complications and delirium were monitored, with a 3-month follow-up assessing functional and cognitive status. Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's tests analyzed clinical and demographic features, and linear regression examined the relationship between follow-up functional autonomy and preoperative cognitive status. Results: Seventy-seven patients (median age: 72 [IQR, 68.00-75.25], 53% males) were included in the study, showing a median Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) of 8 [5.00-8.00]. The median pre-operative Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was 22.88 [19.96-24.80]. 21.4% of patients with impaired cognitive performance at baseline experienced delirium, compared to 2.3% of those without impairment (p=0.052).

Group comparisons were made between rehabilitation facilities (RFs) and nursing homes (NHs). Results Of the participating units/wards, primarily from Europe and Australia, 65 were RFs and 29 were NHs. The overall reported delirium point prevalence was approximately 12%, with higher rates in RFs than in NHs. While most units/wards reported using a validated delirium detection tool, notable differences emerged in the frequency of assessments, the personnel conducting them, and delirium awareness interventions across settings.

This study aims to describe the prevalence of dysphagia and its association with geriatric syndromes in older patients in IC. Methods Prospective cohort study of patients 70 years and older admitted to an IC unit. At admission, the severity of the clinical conditions, comorbidity, delirium, frailty, sarcopenia, nutritional status, and medications were assessed. Each patient was evaluated with the 3-OZ test, and dysphagia was confirmed by a speech therapy consultation. Two multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of dysphagia at admission with geriatric syndromes (model 1), along with the severity of illness and admission diagnosis (model 2). Results A total of 455 patients were included. The prevalence of dysphagia was 10% and there was a high prevalence of mild-moderate dysphagia in patients with cognitive impairment and moderate risk of malnutrition. In the univariate analysis, an association was found between dysphagia and sarcopenia, malnutrition, and use of antipsychotics. In Model 1, higher odds of dysphagia were associated with the severity of comorbidity (Odds Ratio 6.49, 95% Confidence Interval: 2.02–20.78), and cognitive impairment (OR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.88–10.62); in Model 2, the severity of clinical conditions-NEWS2 (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.23–2.13) was associated with dysphagia, besides the severity of comorbidity and cognitive impairment. In a subset of 300 patients, delirium was also associated with dysphagia.

Objective This study applied SFC to test the hypothesis that stepwise architecture propagating from the disease epicenter would shape patterns of brain atrophy in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy–Richardson's syndrome (PSP‐RS). Methods Thirty‐six patients with PSP‐RS and 44 age‐matched healthy control subjects underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging on a 3‐T scanner. The disease epicenter was defined as the peak of atrophy observed in an independent cohort of 13 cases with postmortem confirmation of PSP pathology and used as seed region for SFC analysis. First, we explored SFC rearrangements in patients with PSP‐RS, as compared with age‐matched control subjects. Subsequently, we tested SFC architecture propagating from the disease epicenter as a determinant of brain atrophy distribution. Results The disease epicenter was identified in the left midbrain tegmental region. Compared with age‐matched control subjects, patients with PSP‐RS showed progressively widespread decreased SFC of the midbrain with striatal and cerebellar regions through direct connections and sensorimotor cortical regions through indirect connections. A correlation was found between average link‐step distance from the left midbrain in healthy subjects and brain volumes in patients with PSP‐RS ( r = 0.38, P Conclusions This study provides comprehensive insights into the topology of functional network rearrangements in PSP‐RS and demonstrates that the brain architectural topology, as described by SFC propagating from the disease epicenter, shapes the pattern of atrophic changes in PSP‐RS.

Blood-based markers could facilitate delirium detection and risk stratification. Neurofilament-Light chain (NfL) and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) are promising blood-based markers for neurodegenerative diseases and potential candidates for delirium. This study explored their role as blood-based risk markers for POD in older patients undergoing hip fracture surgery. In this prospective multicohort study, preoperative blood and intraoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected from patients aged ≥65 years with hip fractures. POD was assessed daily using the 4AT scale. NfL and GFAP concentrations in both blood and CSF were compared between POD and Non-POD groups, further stratifying by dementia status. Logistic regression models adjusted for covariates were used to assess associations. A total of 143 patients (median age, 85 years; 76.9% female) were included, with POD occurring in 38 patients (26.6%). Blood NfL and GFAP concentrations were significantly higher in the POD group than in Non-POD (64.55 vs. 44.6 pg/mL and 22 vs. 14.8 pg/mL, P&;lt0.001). CSF NfL levels were also elevated in POD (2154 vs. 1565 pg/mL, P=0.007), but no significant difference was observed for CSF GFAP levels. Higher preoperative blood NfL and GFAP levels independently predicted POD after adjusting for age, sex, dementia, frailty, and Interleukin-6 (Odds Ratio, OR: 3.21, 95% Confidence Interval, CI: 1.26-8.21, and OR: 3.66, 95% CI: 1.38-9.68, respectively).

Methods An online anonymous survey was administered across 30 European countries, via the mailing list of the European Geriatric Medicine Society (EuGMS), national member groups and the authors’ professional networks. Questions were framed in the context of recently hospitalised 80-year-old patients. Results Within the 440 included surveys, respondents particularly over-estimated frailty prevalence in older hospitalised patients, with two-thirds choosing between 41 and 80% prevalence, when the literature suggests only 23–46%, but paradoxically underestimated the frequency of frailty in people with delirium (more than three quarters of responses across 21–80%; literature suggests 71–93%). Severe dementia and previous delirium were correctly considered the strongest risks for future inpatient delirium. However, many considered pre-frailty a moderate (44%) or even strong (19%) risk for future delirium, while a minority considered severe dementia a low risk. Respondents viewed delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) as having the strongest influence on in-hospital mortality and discharge to residential care, dementia as having the strongest influence on future residential care admission, and frailty as the condition most strongly influencing future mortality. Conclusion Geriatricians and experienced geriatric trainees across Europe gave varied responses to questions about delirium, dementia and frailty prevalence, co-occurrence and consequences. This indicates a need for the performance and wide dissemination of robust, prospective research examining all three conditions in older hospital cohorts.

This study aimed to investigate the association between a panel of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) blood biomarkers and longitudinal trajectories of muscle strength. This 12-year population-based cohort study included 2011 dementia-free participants from the Swedish National study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K). Muscle strength was measured through the grip strength and chair stand tests, while baseline levels of AD biomarkers (total tau [t-tau], phosphorylated tau181 [p-tau181], neurofilament light chain [NfL], glial fibrillary acid protein [GFAP], and amyloid-β [Aβ] 42/40 ratio) were assessed by Quanterix Single Molecule Arrays. Linear mixed models, adjusted for socio-demographics and clinical factors, were used to estimate the association between AD biomarkers and muscle strength decline. Higher baseline levels of p-Tau181 (β 0.94, 95%CI 0.72;1.16), NfL (β 0.79, 95%CI 0.59;0.99), and GFAP (β 0.38, 95% CI 0.22;0.54) were associated with an accelerated worsening of the chair stand test over the follow-up.

From baseline to follow‐up (median, IQR 75%‐25%), there was a significant reduction in the NPI total score (NPI baseline = 17 (10.7‐33.2) NPI follow‐up 15.7 (8‐2 – 24.0), p = .002), caregiver distress (NPI caregiver distress baseline = 9.5 (6.0‐17.0); NPI caregiver distress follow‐up 6.5 (2.2‐11.5); p = .003) and TUG score (TUG baseline = 18.0 (13.0 – 35.5); TUG follow‐up 13.4 (10.5‐21.5); p = .007). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the SCQ scale (SCQ baseline = 49.0 (44.0‐64.5) SCQ follow‐up 43.0 (36.5‐56.5); p = .001). No patient experiences hospital admissions at follow‐up while 3 patients had accessed emergency department. Conclusions Preliminary data are very promising and in line with what was hypothesized in the clinical trial design phase. TAP may be a valuable aid in monitoring the BPSDs of PLWD and avoiding re‐hospitalizations.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

While the underlying pathophysiology remains largely unknown, this study aims to explore the association between serum biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and various patterns of cognitive/motor decline. Data are drawn from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen. The rates of cognitive and motor decline were assessed over a 15-year period using linear mixed models, with Mini-Mental State Examination and gait speed as the respective measures. Participants were categorized into slow/non-decliners (reference group, n=1115), fast motor decliners (n=162), fast cognitive decliners (n=162), and dual decliners (n=264). The association between serum AD markers levels and the four decline patterns was analyzed using multinomial logistic regressions. Phosphorylated tau181 (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.60;1.97), neurofilament light chain (OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.31;1.57) and phosphorylated tau181/amyloid-β42 ratio (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.12;1.25) were associated with the highest risk of a dual decline pattern among study participants. In isolated cognitive decliners, robust associations were observed for amyloid-β42, amyloid-β42/40 ratio and glial fibrillary acidic protein, whereas no significant association emerged for those exhibiting only motor decline. Dual decliners present distinct profiles of serum AD biomarkers.

The aim our study was to investigate biological phenotypes in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, exploiting a panel of aging biomarkers. Methods Data were gathered from the FRACOVID Project, an observational multicenter study, aimed to evaluate the impact of frailty on health-related outcomes in patients 60 + with COVID-19 in Northern Italy. A hierarchical cluster analysis was run using log-transformed and scaled values of TNF-a, IL-1 beta, IL-6, PAI-1, GDF-15, NT-proBNP, and Cystatin C evaluated at admission. Results Eighty-one participants (mean age 75.3 years; 60.5% male) were evaluated. Frailty was identified in 42% of the sample and 27.2% were unable to ambulate outdoors. The mean hospital stay was 24.7 days, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 18.5%. Three biological phenotypes were found: (1) ‘inflammatory’, with high inflammatory biomarkers; (2) ‘organ dysfunction’, characterized by elevated cystatin C and NT-proBNP, and lower inflammatory markers; and (3) ‘unspecific’, with lower NT-proBNP and GDF-15 levels, and intermediate concentrations of other biomarkers. The ’organ dysfunction’ phenotype showed the highest mean age and prevalence of frailty, disability, and chronic diseases. The ‘inflammatory‘ phenotype showed the highest burden of respiratory and systemic signs and symptoms of infection. Conclusion Biological phenotypes might be used to identify different clinical and functional phenotypes in individuals affected by COVID-19.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

Understanding their interdependency is crucial to identify shared mechanisms and implement initiatives to reduce the associated burden. This literature review summarizes scientific evidence on the complex interplay between frailty and delirium; clinical, epidemiological, and pathophysiological commonalities; and current knowledge gaps. We conducted a PubMed systematic search in June 2023, which yielded 118 eligible articles out of 991. The synthesis of the results—carried out by content experts—highlights overlapping risk factors, clinical phenotypes, and outcomes and explores the influence of one syndrome on the onset of the other. Common pathophysiological mechanisms identified include inflammation, neurodegeneration, metabolic insufficiency, and vascular burden. The review suggests that frailty is a risk factor for delirium, with some support for delirium associated with accelerated frailty. The proposed unifying framework supports the integration and measurement of both constructs in research and clinical practice, identifying the geroscience approach as a potential avenue to develop strategies for both conditions. In conclusion, we suggest that frailty and delirium might be alternative—sometimes coexisting—manifestations of accelerated biological aging. Clinically, the concepts addressed in this review can help approach older adults with either frailty or delirium from a different perspective. From a research standpoint, longitudinal studies are needed to explore the hypothesis that specific pathways within the biology of aging may underlie the clinical manifestations of frailty and delirium. Such research will pave the way for future understanding of other geriatric syndromes as well.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

Evaluating the effects of plasma from older individuals with frailty (frail plasma) on allogeneic renal stem/progenitor cells, we showed significant functional impairment and nuclear DNA damage in the treated cells of the renal stem compartment. The analysis of the frail plasma revealed mitochondrial functional impairment associated with the activation of oxidative stress and a unique inflammatory mediator profile in frail individuals. In addition, the plasma of frail subjects also contained the highest percentage of DNA-damaged autologous circulating hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells. The integration of both molecular and functional data obtained allowed us to discern patterns associated with frailty status, irrespective of the comorbidities present in the frail individuals.

A strong association between cardiovascular events and the occurrence of delirium has been recorded. Thus far, no data are available regarding the risk of incident cardiovascular events after delirium onset in older adults. Methods Using data from TriNetX, a global health federated research network, we performed a propensity score matched (PSM) analysis of older adults (age ≥65 years) admitted to the emergency department (ED) reporting delirium within two weeks, who were compared with those without delirium. We evaluated the occurrence of a composite outcome of cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, heart failure, intracranial haemorrhage, ventricular arrhythmias, takotsubo syndrome, and atrial fibrillation) at 30 days and 1 and 3 years of follow-up. Results 4,480,229 patients were retrieved for the analysis, and 82,693 (1.8%) reported delirium. Before PSM, patients reporting delirium were older, with more prevalent comorbidities. After PSM, a total of 165,386 patients were included in the analysis (mean (SD) age 76.6 (9.0) years, 51.1% females). Throughout the entire follow-up period, the cumulative composite cardiovascular events outcome was significantly higher in patients which reported delirium [Red Line, Figure 1]. Delirium was associated with cardiovascular events at 30 days (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.92-2.00) ,1 year (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.72-1.78) and 3 years (HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.64-1.69) of follow-up, as well as for each of its components (Table 1). The presence of delirium was also associated with a higher risk of all-cause death and hospital access (Table 1), evaluated as secondary outcomes. In patients with delirium associated with the occurrence of incident cardiovascular events, there was a higher risk of recurrent cardiovascular events at 1 year (HR 3.11, 95% CI 2.92-3.31) and 3 years (HR 2.84, 95% CI 2.67-3.01) of follow-up.

This study aims to evaluate the delirium point prevalence and its management across Italian hospitals, categorized by delirium literacy levels. Additionally, it seeks to identify prevailing barriers and future priorities in delirium practice and research. Methods We analyzed data from World Delirium Awareness Day (WDAD) on March 15th, 2023, collected by participating clinicians in Italian hospitals. High delirium literacy (HL) was determined based on the use of validated delirium assessment tools and the presence of a written protocol for delirium management. Conversely, low delirium literacy (LL) was determined by meeting only one or neither of these criteria. Results Fifty-eight hospital wards participated in the survey, with 25 (43.1%) classified as HL. The overall reported point prevalence of delirium was found to be approximately 10%. Notably, the reported prevalence was twice as high in the HL group compared to the LL group. Despite minimal differences compared to the other group, the HL group demonstrated greater adherence to appropriate delirium management strategies, encompassing both non-pharmacological and pharmacological strategies. Critical gaps in delirium care emerged, including suboptimal management practices, barriers to implementing evidence-based strategies, and insufficient awareness and training among professionals. Conclusion The study highlights the suboptimal identification and management of delirium among Italian hospitals, emphasizing the necessity of enhancing awareness and implementing evidence-based strategies. Addressing these shortcomings is crucial for optimizing delirium care, improving patient outcomes, and mitigating the burden of delirium in hospital settings.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

Methods This is a single‐arm study to evaluate the feasibility of the TAP approach to promote continuity of care between hospital (S. Gerardo hospital ‐ Italy) and community. Inclusion criteria were presence of NPS; autonomy in activities of daily living (Katz’s index ≥ 2); presence of caregiver. On recruitment, PLWD underwent a multidimensional assessment, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Katz’s Index, Timed‐Up‐and‐Go‐test (TUG), number of drugs taken by the patient and caregiver’s sense of competence (SCQ questionnaire). After recruitment, the dyad PwD+caregiver received 8 TAP sessions performed by two occupational therapists, at hospital (two sessions) and at home (6 sessions). Follow‐up was set after 4 mouths. The attrition rate (% of dropouts) was the primary outcome. Results 51 patients identified as potentially eligible, 21 declined to participate in the project. Currently, 30 dyads have been recruited, with 16 having completed the follow‐up. Overall, there were 6 (20%) dropouts. The mean patient’s age was 81 ±4.8 years. The median CFS patient’s score was 6 and half of patients were taking more than 7 medications per day. Wilcoxon signed‐rank test was conducted on the 16 dyads. From baseline to follow‐up (median, IQR 75%‐25%), there was a significant reduction in the NPI total score (NPI baseline = 17 (10.7‐33.2) NPI follow‐up 15.7 (8‐2 – 24.0), p = .002), caregiver distress (NPI caregiver distress baseline = 9.5 (6.0‐17.0); NPI caregiver distress follow‐up 6.5 (2.2‐11.5); p = .003) and TUG score (TUG baseline = 18.0 (13.0 – 35.5); TUG follow‐up 13.4 (10.5‐21.5); p = .007). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the SCQ scale (SCQ baseline = 49.0 (44.0‐64.5) SCQ follow‐up 43.0 (36.5‐56.5); p = .001). No patient experiences hospital admissions at follow‐up while 3 patients had accessed emergency department. Conclusions Preliminary data are very promising and in line with what was hypothesized in the clinical trial design phase.

Design Secondary analysis of a worldwide one-day point prevalence study on World Delirium Awareness Day, 15 March 2023. Setting Cross-sectional online survey including hospitals, rehabilitation and long-term facilities. Methods Participating clinicians reported data on delirium, the presence of protocols, delirium assessments, delirium-awareness interventions, non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions, and ward/unit-specific barriers. Results Data from 44 countries, 1664 wards/units and 36 048 patients were analysed. Validated delirium assessments were used in 66.7% (n = 1110) of wards/units, 18.6% (n = 310) used personal judgement or no assessment, and 10% (n = 166) used other assessment methods. A delirium management protocol was reported in 66.8% (n = 1094) of wards/units. The presence of protocols for delirium management varied across continents, ranging from 21.6% (on 21/97 wards/units) in Africa to 90.4% (235/260) in Australia, similar to the use of validated delirium assessments with 29.6% (29/98) in Africa to 93.5% (116/124) in North America. Wards/units with a delirium management protocol [n = 1094/1664, 66.8%] were more likely to use a validated delirium test than those without a protocol [odds ratio 6.97 (95% confidence interval 5.289–9.185)]. The presence of a delirium protocol increased the chances for valid delirium assessment and, likely, evidence-based interventions.

However, the role exerted by AF on the long-term trajectories of functional mobility remains to be elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of AF on functional mobility by tracing walking speed (WS) trajectories over 15 years of follow-up in a population-based cohort of individuals aged 60+ years. Methods and results This population-based cohort study included 3141 community-dwelling participants (mean age 73.7 years; 63.6% women) from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, who were regularly examined from 2001–2004 to 2016–2019. Functional mobility was assessed by measuring WS in a standardized way. The association between AF and WS trajectories was assessed by multivariable joint models accounting for the longitudinal dropouts due to death. Stratified analyses by demographic and clinical factors were performed. The effect-modifying role of oral anticoagulant therapy (OAC), incident heart failure (HF), and incident stroke was finally investigated. At baseline, 285 (9.1%) participants were ascertained to have AF. A faster annual WS decline was observed in persons with AF than in non-AF peers (adjusted β coefficient per year = −0.011, 95% confidence interval: −0.016 to −0.005). Incident HF and stroke were associated with greater WS decline in participants with AF. OAC use was not associated with a slower functional decline. Conclusion Atrial fibrillation is associated with a faster physical function decline in older individuals. Incident HF and stroke possibly accelerate WS decline over time in AF participants.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

The aim of this study was to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of the Recognizing Acute Delirium As part of your Routine (RADAR) scale in an Italian hospital. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 150 patients aged ≥70 years were enrolled. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) criterion-defined delirium as the gold standard were plotted to evaluate the performance of the RADAR scale. The cut-off suggested by previous research was used to estimate the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the RADAR scale. The involved patients were mostly females (60%; n = 90), with a median age of 84 years (I–III quartiles: 80–88). According to the CAM and the RADAR scale, 37 (25%) and 58 (39%) patients were classified as experiencing delirium, respectively. The area under the ROC curve of the RADAR scale was 0.916. Furthermore, the RADAR scale showed robust sensitivity (95%), specificity (80%), and positive (60%) and negative predictive values (98%). The RADAR scale is thus suggested to be a valid tool for screening assessment of delirium in hospitalized older adults.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

The interventions for preventing and managing this condition are still poorly known. The aim of this umbrella review is to synthesize and grade all preventative and therapeutic interventions for delirium. We searched five databases from database inception up to March 15th, 2023 and we included meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to decrease the risk of/the severity of delirium. From 1959 records after deduplication, we included 59 systematic reviews with meta-analyses, providing 110 meta-analytic estimates across populations, interventions, outcomes, settings, and age groups (485 unique RCTs, 172,045 participants). In surgery setting, for preventing delirium, high GRADE evidence supported dexmedetomidine (RR=0.53; 95%CI: 0.46-0.67, k=13, N=3988) and comprehensive geriatric assessment (OR=0.46; 95%CI=0.32-0.67, k=3, N=496) in older adults, dexmedetomidine in adults (RR=0.33, 95%CI=0.24-0.45, k=7, N=1974), A2-adrenergic agonists after induction of anesthesia (OR= 0.28, 95%CI= 0.19-0.40, k=10, N=669) in children. High certainty evidence did not support melatonergic agents in older adults for delirium prevention. Moderate certainty supported the effect of dexmedetomidine in adults and children (k=4), various non-pharmacological interventions in adults and older people (k=4), second-generation antipsychotics in adults and mixed age groups (k=3), EEG-guided anesthesia in adults (k=2), mixed pharmacological interventions (k=1), five other specific pharmacological interventions in children (k=1 each). In conclusion, our work indicates that effective treatments to prevent delirium differ across populations, settings, and age groups. Results inform future guidelines to prevent or treat delirium, accounting for safety and costs of interventions. More research is needed in non-surgical settings.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

The urgency of combatting COVID-19 led to the dissemination of medical recommendations with a scarce awareness of possible drug–drug interactions. This issue primarily concerned people already taking multiple medications, such as older individuals. We estimated the prevalence of drug interactions with CQ or HCQ in COVID-19 inpatients during the first pandemic waves and their possible association with hospitalization-related outcomes. Methods: This study considers 487 patients aged ≥60, hospitalized for COVID-19 from March to December 2020, and treated with CQ or HCQ. Data on acute and chronic therapies and hospitalization length and outcomes were derived from medical records. The presence of drugs potentially interacting with CQ and HCQ was identified based on published literature and drug databases. Results: In our sample (mean age 77.1 years, 47.8% females), 255 (52.4%) patients presented with one drug interaction with CQ or HCQ, and 114 (23.4%) had more than two interactions. The most frequent drugs potentially interacting with CQ or HCQ were lopinavir/ritonavir (50.4%), azithromycin (47.2%), tocilizumab (15.4%), levofloxacin (8.7%), clarithromycin (6.0%), amlodipine (3.3%), and trazodone (2.4%). No substantial differences in the duration and outcomes of the hospitalization emerged as a function of the presence of drug–drug interactions. Conclusions: Many older patients prescribed with CQ or HCQ, which have lately proved ineffective against COVID-19, were exposed to the risk of drug–drug interaction.

Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by a reduction in physiological functional reserve and ability to maintain homeostasis, resulting in an increased vulnerability to adverse events. Frailty prevalence increases with age therefore BP variability (BPV) can be significantly increased in older frail patients. Nevertheless, the management of hypertension in older and frail patients has received little attention in the literature and represents an unresolved clinical question. We aimed to evaluate short term BPV in a cohort of elderly hypertensive patients and evaluate its association with frailty. Design and method: In this monocentric cross-sectional study we recruited hypertensive patients aged 75 years or older, evaluated at the Hypertension Center of Istituto Auxologico italiano IRCCS from May 2022 to August 2023. All patients underwent 24-hour blood pressure monitoring and a comprehensive geriatric assessment. Frailty was assessed through the Frailty Index (FI) according to the Rockwood's accumulation model. Based on the FI patients were classified as Fit (FI 0.25). Results: 131 patients were recruited and a total of 106 patients were analysed because of missing data. The median age was 80 years [76-83], included patients were predominantly females (73%). Overall, 23 were fit, 50 in the pre-frailty category and 33 were frail. For each of the 7 systolic BPV indices considered, we fitted a multivariable linear model to estimate their relationship with continuous FI adjusting for age, sex, BMI, short physical performance battery, mini mental state examination, presence of falls in the last year, median 24h systolic blood pressure, mean diastolic 24h blood pressure and mean 24h heart rate. A significant positive association was observed only for SD night as depicted in Table 1. Conclusions: Nighttime BPV was associated with frailty in a cohort of elderly hypertensive subjects. The mechanisms behind this association and its impact on cardiovascular risk stratification in elderly patients should be further investigated.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

Previous studies suggested that unexplained falls may mask a syncope or pseudo-syncope in almost 50% of cases, and that patients with reflex syncope have a higher prevalence of systolic blood pressure (SBP) drops on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), the so-called hypotensive phenotype. However, it is not clear whether hypotensive phenotype may be itself associated with falls. We investigate if hypotensive phenotype is associated with history of falls in elderly hypertensive. Design and method: a cross-sectional study that included treated hypertensive patients aged >=75 years evaluated at the Hypertension Center of Istituto Auxologico Italiano IRCCS in Milan. We excluded patients with a life expectancy of less than 6 months. All participants underwent ABPM. History of falls within the last year was recorded and multidimensional geriatric assessment to estimate frailty using Frailty accumulation index was performed. Daytime and night-time hypotensive phenotypes were defined as at least one SBP drops Results: we enrolled 105 patients, mainly females (n=80, 76%) with a mean age of 82 (± 4) years. In 74 (70%) patients day-time hypotensive phenotype was present at ABPM, while nighttime hypotensive phenotype was present in 24 of them (23%). Among participants 21 (20%) experienced a fall in the last 12 months; compared for age, sex, BMI, frailty index and BP patients with falls and not have no significant differences. Regardless of SBP cut-off, nocturnal hypotensive phenotype was associated with history of falls while daytime hypotensive phenotype was not. (Figure 1). Conclusions: In our study, nighttime but not daytime BP drops were associated with falls in treated hypertensive elderly patients. The mechanistic role of nighttime hypotensive phenotype and its association with syncope and falls will need to be evaluated in larger prospective studies to better clarify the utility of ABPM in falls prediction in elderly.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

We aimed to perform an updated systematic review of the literature and proportional meta-analysis to assess prevalence and incidence of delirium in older adults with COVID-19, addressing differences according to sex, frailty status, and settings. Methods We searched databases for English-language articles on prevalence and incidence of delirium in older adults with COVID-19, published between March 2020 and January 2023. Results Of the 1171 articles identified, 66 met selection criteria and were included in the meta-analysis ( n = 35,035 participants, age-range 66–90 years old, 46.6% females). We observed similar pooled prevalence (20.6% [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 17.8–23.8%]) and incidence (21.3% [95% CI 14.7–30%]) of delirium. Pooled occurrence (both prevalence and incidence) of delirium was similar according to sex (females 21.3% [95% CI 16–27.5%] vs. males 23.8%% [95% CI 18.2–30.4%], p -value = 0.55) and study setting (nursing homes 22.5% [95% CI 14.2–33.6%] vs. hospital 20.3% [95% CI 17–24%], p = 0.68), but it was significantly higher in frail versus non-frail patients (37% [95% CI 26.6–48.8%] vs. 12.5% [95% CI 7.8–19.6%], p -value Conclusion This review delineates delirium as a common feature of COVID-19, particularly in frail older adults, and supports its formal inclusion among COVID-19 symptoms.

Little is known about the possible association between RF and delirium, and whether these two syndromes, alone or in combination, may affect short-term mortality. Objectives: To investigate prevalence and features of RF, the association between delirium and RF, and their effect on short-term mortality. Design: Prospective cross-sectional study with data collection on an index day and 30-day follow up. Setting and Participants: 1493 patients aged ≥ 65 years hospitalized in Italian acute medical wards from the 2017 Delirium Day database. Methods: RF was identified according to the detection of peripheral oxygen saturation ≤ 91% on the index day, or to ongoing oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation on the index day or the day before. A modified National Early Warning Score (NEWS), obtained removing the “Oxygen Saturations” and “Any Supplemental Oxygen” items, measured non-hypoxemic severity of acute illness. Results: 300 patients (20.1%) had RF. Mortality was 16.6% in the RF group and 8.2% in the non-RF group (p&lt;0.001). Delirium prevalence was 31.3% in RF (94 patients, 72 of whom with hypoactive or mixed delirium) and 22% in non-RF patients (p&lt;0.001).

Objective: Describe the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on people living at Il Paese Ritrovato through a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) regularly administered prior to and during the pandemic. Methods: We explored the effects of a person-centered approach. We assessed 64 subjects (enrolled and followed between June 2018 and December 2020), who underwent at least 18 months of observation prior to the pandemic. Each subject was evaluated using a CGA on admission time (T0) and at defined time-points: T6, T12, T18. One last CGA evaluation was performed during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (TCovid-19). Temporal trends during T0–T18, and differences between T18 and TCovid-19 were calculated. Results: The mean age was 82 years with a prevalence for females (77.0%) and Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis (60%). Psychiatric and behavioral disorders were the most common conditions (80%). We utilized a nonpharmacological approach aimed at promoting the residents’ overall wellbeing and observed satisfactory performance during the first 18 months. In comparison with the pre-pandemic period, TCovid-19 enlightened +11.7% use of antidepressants and a decline of Mini-Mental State Examination mean values (not statistically significant), while engagement in activities dropped.

Tailored Activity Program is a non-pharmacological approach which has shown to reduce neuropsychiatric symptoms and functional dependence of persons living with dementia at the community, as well as caregiver’s distress. The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of a project in which the Tailored Activity Program is delivered partially at an acute hospital ward and partially at the patient's home. Material and Methods: The study is aimed at enrolling 50 dyads (patients/caregivers) from the memory clinic, acute geriatric ward, or short-stay emergency department at the IRCCS San Gerardo dei Tintori, Monza (Italy). Inclusion criteria are: the patient’s clinical diagnosis of dementia, clinically detectable neuropsychiatric symptoms (Neuro Psychiatric Inventory, NPI score >6 in at least one item), the ability to participate in activities of daily living (Katz’s index ≥ 2), the presence of a caregiver (aged ≥ 21 years; minimum 4 hours of daily care), and the willingness of the dyad patient/caregiver to participate in the project. Treatment is delivered both i) in hospital (2 sessions) and ii) at home (6 sessions), including occupational therapy, telemedicine and nursing care provided once a week. The following variables are measured: Neuro Psychiatric Inventory, Time Up and Go Test, Katz’s Index and the level of caregiver’s sense of competence with the Sense of Competence Questionnaire. Data are collected both at baseline, at the end of the treatment, with a follow-up scheduled at 4 months after enrollment. Primary outcome measure is the dyad's retention rate at 4-month follow-up. Secondary outcomes are the reduction in the patient’s frequency and severity of NPS; the improvement in the patient’s Time Up and Go Test score; the improvement in the patient's levels of autonomy and participation in activities of daily living and improvement in the caregiver’s Sense of Competence Questionnaire score. Results and Conclusion: We seek to evaluate whether the Tailored Activity Program is well-received by the patient/caregiver dyad and, consequently, whether our project is feasible. If this objective is achieved, and if we also report some improvement in the secondary outcomes, we can then plan a larger multicenter study aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of this approach, partly delivered at the hospital and partly at patient’s home.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

This study aims to identify and characterise cardio-pulmonary sequelae, in patients hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, at 24 months follow-up. This is a prospective, observational cohort study conducted on consecutive patients hospitalised for COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure. Patients were followed up at 24 months with complete pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 6-min walking test and a dyspnoea score (Modified Medical Research Council scale). A subgroup of patients with at least one clinical or functional sign suggestive of increased pulmonary pressures also underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate the presence of direct or indirect signs of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Ninety consecutive patients (74% men, median age 59.1 years) were enrolled in the study. In regard to PFTs, carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) impairment was observed in 23 cases (26%), in all cases of mild entity. When considering the dyspnoea, 30 (34%) patients showed some degree of breathlessness. Forty patients underwent TTE. No patients had overt PH or chronic thromboembolic PH. However, all patients showed a hyperdynamic state of the right ventricle, and 8 (20%) patients had a decreased acceleration time on pulmonary valve, signs of increased pulmonary vasculature resistances and afterload elevation. At 24-month follow-up after severe COVID-19, DLCO and TTE prove to be the most sensitive tool to detect cardio-pulmonary sequelae.

It determines an increased vulnerability to endogenous and exogenous stressors and can lead to poor outcomes. It is an emerging concept in perioperative medicine, since an increasing number of patients undergoing surgical interventions are older and the traditional models of care seem to be inadequate to satisfy these patients' emerging clinical needs. Nowadays, the progressive technical and clinical improvements allow to offer cardiac operations to an older, sicker and frail population. For these reasons, a multidisciplinary team involving cardiac surgeons, clinical cardiologists, anesthesiologists, and geriatricians, is often needed to assess, select and provide tailored care to these high-risk frail patients to optimize clinical outcomes. There is unanimous agreement that frailty assessment may capture the individual's biological decline and the heterogeneity in risk profile for poor health-related outcomes among people of the same age. However, since commonly used preoperative scores for cardiac surgery fail to capture frailty, a specific preoperative assessment with dedicated tools is warranted to correctly recognize, measure and quantify frailty in these patients. On the contrary, pre-operative and post-operative interventions can reduce the risk of complications and support patient recovery promoting surgical resilience. Minimally invasive cardiac procedures aim to reduce surgical trauma and may be associated with better clinical outcome in this specific sub-group of high-risk patients. Among postoperative adverse events, the occurrence of delirium represents a risk factor for several unfavorable outcomes including mortality and subsequent cognitive decline. Its presence should be carefully recognized, triggering an adequate, evidence based, treatment. There is evidence, from several cross-section and longitudinal studies, that frailty and delirium may frequently overlap, with frailty serving both as a predisposing factor and as an outcome of delirium and delirium being a marker of a latent condition of frailty. In conclusion, frail patients are at increased risk to experience poor outcome after cardiac surgery. A multidisciplinary approach aimed to recognize more vulnerable individuals, optimize pre-operative conditions, reduce surgical invasivity and improve post-operative recovery is required to obtain optimal long-term outcome.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

In the last decade, point-of-care thoracic ultrasound has entered clinical practice for diagnosis and management of several respiratory illnesses, such as bacterial and viral pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute heart failure, and pneumothorax, especially in the emergency–urgency setting. Very few studies, however, have been specifically focused on older patients with frailty and multi-morbidity, who frequently exhibit complex clinical pictures needing multidimensional evaluation. At the present state of knowledge, there is still uncertainty on the best requirements of ultrasound equipment, methodology of examination, and reporting needed to optimize the advantages of thoracic ultrasound implementation in the care of geriatric patients. Other issues regard differential diagnosis between bacterial and aspiration pneumonia, objective grading of interstitial syndrome severity, quantification and monitoring of pleural effusions and solid pleural lesions, significance of ultrasonographic assessment of post-COVID-19 sequelae, and prognostic value of assessment of diaphragmatic thickness and motility. Finally, application of remote ultrasound diagnostics in the community and nursing home setting is still poorly investigated by the current literature.

Methods An online Delphi survey with 30 questions regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical features, and treatment of depression in AD was administered anonymously to a panel of 53 expert clinicians. Results Consensus was achieved in most cases (86%). In the 80% of statements, a positive consensus was reached, while in 6% a negative consensus was achieved. No consensus was obtained in 14%. Among the most relevant findings, the link between depression and AD is believed to be strong and concerns etiopathogenesis and phenomenology. Further, depression in AD seems to have specific features compared to major depressive disorder (MDD). Regarding diagnosis, the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for MDD seems to be not able to detect the specific aspects of depression in AD. Concerning treatment, antidepressant drugs are generally considered the main option for depression in dementia, according to previous guidelines. In order to limit side effects, multimodal and SSRI antidepressant are preferred by clinicians. In particular, the procognitive effect of vortioxetine seems to be appealing for the treatment of depression in AD. Conclusions This study highlights some crucial aspects of depression in AD, but more investigations and specific recommendations are needed.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

This study aims to evaluate whether the frailty of NCD patients was associated with different changes in multiple health domains, in particular in relation to loneliness and social isolation, pre‐ and post‐lockdown. Materials and Methods Patients were recruited from 10 Italian Centers for Cognitive Disorders and Dementia. Data were collected in the pre‐pandemic period (T0), during the pandemic lockdown (T1), and 6–9 months post‐lockdown (T2). The UCLA Loneliness Scale‐3, Activities of Daily Living (ADL), Instrumental ADL (IADL), Mini‐Mental State Examination, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were administered. Caregivers' burden was also tested. Patients were categorized as non‐frail, pre‐frail, and frail according to the Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illness, and Loss of Weight scale. Results The sample included 165 subjects (61.9% women, mean age 79.5 ± 4.9 years). In the whole sample, the ADL, IADL, and NPI scores significantly declined between T0 and T2. There were no significative variations in functional and cognitive domains between the frail groups. During lockdown we recorded higher Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Perceived Stress Scale scores in frail people. In multivariable logistic regression, frailty was associated with an increase in social isolation, and a loss of IADL. Conclusions We observed a global deterioration in functional and neuro‐psychiatric domains irrespective of the degree of frailty. Frailty was associated with the worsening of social isolation during lockdown. Frail patients and their caregivers seemed to experience more anxiety and stress disorders during SARS‐CoV‐2 pandemic.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate frailty in patients aged 65 years and older referred to two Centers for Cognitive Decline and Dementia (CCDDs). Methods A total of 1256 patients consecutively referred for a first visit to two CCDDs in Lombardy (Italy) between January 2021 to July 2022 were included. All patients were evaluated by an expert physician in diagnosis and care of dementia according to a standardized clinical protocol. Frailty was assessed using a 24-items Frailty Index (FI) based on routinely collected health records, excluding cognitive decline or dementia, and categorized as mild, moderate, and severe. Results Overall, 40% of patients were affected by mild frailty and 25% of the sample has moderate to severe frailty. The prevalence and severity of frailty increased with decreasing Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and advancing age. Frailty was also detected in 60% of patients with mild cognitive impairment. Conclusion Frailty is common in patients referring to CCDDs for cognitive deficits. Its systematic assessment using a FI generated with readily available medical information could help develop appropriate models of assistance and guide personalization of care.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

The diagnosis of depression in parkinsonian patients represents a challenge due to the overlapping of symptoms typical of the two conditions. Methods A Delphi panel survey was performed to reach a consensus amongst different Italian specialists on four main topics: the neuropathological correlates of depression, main clinical aspects, diagnosis, and management of depression in Parkinson’s disease. Results and conclusion Experts have recognized that depression is an established risk factor of PD and that its anatomic substrate is related to the neuropathological abnormalities typical of the disease. Multimodal and SSRI antidepressant have been confirmed as a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of depression in PD. Tolerability, safety profile, and potential efficacy on broad spectrum of symptoms of depression including cognitive symptoms and anhedonia should be considered when selecting an antidepressant and the choice should be tailored on the patients’ characteristics.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A

A range of outbreak control measures are still implemented in most facilities involving administrations, staff, residents and their families. This study aims to evaluate which measure could influence the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection among residents during the period March 2021-June 2022. Methods We enrolled 3,272 residents aged ≥60 years. The outbreak control measures adopted to prevent or manage the infection included entry regulations, contact-regulating procedures, and virological surveillance of residents and staff. The association between LTCFs' and participants' characteristics with new cases of COVID-19 infections was analyzed using multilevel logistic regression models. Results In 33.8% of the facilities 261 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Among participant characteristics, gender and age were not associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while having received the vaccine booster dose was protective against infection [Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.34, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.12–0.99, p = 0.048]. In addition, the implementation of protected areas for family visits was associated with a significant reduction of the probability of infections (OR = 0.18, 95% CI 0.03–0.98, p = 0.047). Overall, about 66% of the variability in the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the observational period may be due to facility structure characteristics and 34% to the participant characteristics.

While the smart home is the chosen scenario for such technologies, a variety of environments could potentially benefit from the synergies between IoT and digital applications. Among them, the clinical waiting rooms is an environment facing several challenges, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical waiting rooms are crowded places associated with stress and anxiety, often linked to patients’ idling time. Nonetheless, the rise of IoT-enabled telehealth has focused attention on the possibility of changing the functions of clinical waiting rooms. In this work, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify the existing solutions for “smart waiting rooms”. The review process started with 278 works, and it identified 16 papers relevant to the topic of smart clinical waiting rooms. Moreover, the results of this review underlined that waiting rooms are a neglected research area that could take advantage of IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance patients’ experience and support the diagnostic process. Leveraging the research directions identified in the review process, this work proposes a “Smart Waiting Room” that exploits virtual reality (VR), AI, and IoT technologies to support the diagnostic process (via a cognitive assessment) and the personalization of the patient’s context—taking into account the features of the physical environment.

However, the characteristics associated with the improvement in the patient conditions during the ICU stay were not fully elucidated for each population as well as the possible differences between the two. Goal The aim of this study is to highlight the differences between the prognostic clinical features for the survival of patients diagnosed with SIRS and those of patients diagnosed with sepsis by using a multi-variable predictive modeling approach with a reduced set of easily available measurements collected at the admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). Methods Data were collected from 1,257 patients (816 non-sepsis SIRS and 441 sepsis) admitted to the ICU. We compared the performance of five machine learning models in predicting patient survival. Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was used to evaluate model performances and feature importance, and by applying Monte Carlo stratified Cross-Validation. Results Extreme Gradient Boosting (MCC = 0.489) and Logistic Regression (MCC = 0.533) achieved the highest results for SIRS and sepsis cohorts, respectively. In order of importance, APACHE II, mean platelet volume ( MPV ), eosinophil counts ( EoC ), and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) showed higher importance for predicting sepsis patient survival, whereas, SOFA, APACHE II, platelet counts ( PLTC ), and CRP obtained higher importance in the SIRS cohort. Conclusion By using complete blood count parameters as predictors of ICU patient survival, machine learning models can accurately predict the survival of SIRS and sepsis ICU patients. Interestingly, feature importance highlights the role of CRP and APACHE II in both SIRS and sepsis populations. In addition, MPV and EoC are shown to be important features for the sepsis population only, whereas SOFA and PLTC have higher importance for SIRS patients.",Davide Chicco,CHCDVD84R18D969F

Diabetes can have serious long-term health consequences, such as cardiovascular diseases, strokes, chronic kidney diseases, foot ulcers, retinopathy, and others. Even if common, this disease is uneasy to spot, because it often comes with no symptoms. Especially for diabetes type 2, that happens mainly in the adults, knowing how long the diabetes has been present for a patient can have a strong impact on the treatment they can receive. This information, although pivotal, might be absent: for some patients, in fact, the year when they received the diabetes diagnosis might be well-known, but the year of the disease unset might be unknown. In this context, machine learning applied to electronic health records can be an effective tool to predict the past duration of diabetes for a patient. In this study, we applied a regression analysis based on several computational intelligence methods to a dataset of electronic health records of 73 patients with diabetes type 1 with 20 variables and another dataset of records of 400 patients of diabetes type 2 with 49 variables. Among the algorithms applied, Random Forests was able to outperform the other ones and to efficiently predict diabetes duration for both the cohorts, with the regression performances measured through the coefficient of determination R 2 . Afterwards, we applied the same method for feature ranking, and we detected the most relevant factors of the clinical records correlated with past diabetes duration: age, insulin intake, and body-mass index. Our study discoveries can have profound impact on clinical practice: when the information about the duration of diabetes of patient is missing, medical doctors can use our tool and focus on age, insulin intake, and body-mass index to infer this important aspect. Regarding limitations, unfortunately we were unable to find additional dataset of EHRs of patients with diabetes having the same variables of the two analyzed here, so we could not verify our findings on a validation cohort.",Davide Chicco,CHCDVD84R18D969F

Initially, a longitudinal-cluster analysis was conducted using five-point longitudinal data to categorize subjects into clusters based on the progression of CDR domains during the follow-up. Then, a statistical analysis was performed on the identified clusters to ascertain whether, at the baseline, patients exhibiting stability have different profiles about CDR domains compared to patients who converted to an AD during the whole follow-up period.

Sensory Design was identified as a suitable approach to design comfortable and customisable environments for the different CdC’s users. Sensory environments aim at favouring mental health, rehabilitation and comfort in healthcare facilities, reducing stress during the waiting time and before or during the medical intervention as a positive distraction. Scientific literature is still not expanded in this field. The contribution aims at studying the application of Sensory Design in an innovative context such as the CdC environment to support healthy and active ageing. This design approach favours the stimulation of primary senses and self-regulated emotions to generate positive feelings, reduce stress, promote relaxation, physical activity and recovery. According to a Theoretical Framework, best practices have been analysed to identify spatial and environmental sensory characters to be applied in designing CdC’s welcome and waiting spaces. The authors have identified four main categories of sensory features for CdC: i) innovative Spatial Models: designing the building according to a multisensory approach to stimulate and welcome people in an inclusive way; diffusing sensory equipment in public spaces (e.g., corridors, waiting spaces, etc.); designing sensory atrium or waiting spaces; providing snoezelen rooms as dedicated and specific rooms for sensory recovery; making environments adaptable trough portable sensory equipment; ii) Relaxing features to promote comfort and psychological support; iii) Physical activity promotion, according to the idea of healthy and active ageing; iv) the integration of sensory solutions by the use of digital technology.",Elena  Bellini,BLLLNE87B46A564T

This process is crucial for developing age-related diseases, where excessive calorie intake accelerates metabolic dysfunction and aging. Overnutrition disturbs key metabolic pathways, including insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and AMP-activated protein kinase. The dysregulation of these pathways contributes to insulin resistance, impaired autophagy, exacerbated oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction, further enhancing cellular senescence and systemic metabolic derangements. On the other hand, dysfunctional endothelial cells and adipocytes contribute to systemic inflammation, reduced nitric oxide production, and altered lipid metabolism. Numerous factors, including extracellular vesicles, mediate pathological communication between the vascular system and adipose tissue, amplifying metabolic imbalances. Meanwhile, caloric restriction (CR) emerges as a potent intervention to counteract overnutrition effects, improve mitochondrial function, reduce oxidative stress, and restore metabolic balance. CR modulates pathways such as IIS, mTOR, and sirtuins, enhancing glucose and lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and promoting autophagy. CR can extend the health span and mitigate age-related diseases by delaying cellular senescence and improving healthy endothelial–adipocyte interactions. This review highlights the crosstalk between endothelial cells and adipocytes, emphasizing CR potential in counteracting overnutrition-induced senescence and restoring vascular homeostasis.",Maria Grazia Andreassi,NDRMGR66P66C349Y

As liver injury progresses to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), MASLD can predispose individuals to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Here, we characterized the first knockout mouse model for mitogen-activated protein kinase 15 (MAPK15) and revealed its critical role in controlling lipid homeostasis in the liver. Indeed, Mapk15 -/- mice exhibited a MASLD-like phenotype, and hepatocellular models allowed us to demonstrate that dysregulated accumulation of lipids was due to increased expression and membrane localization of the CD36 fatty acid translocase. Consistently, Mapk15 -/- mice exhibited elevated hepatic levels of CD36 and feeding them with a western-type diet significantly accelerated their progression to a MASH-like phenotype. Ultimately, transcriptomic analysis of human cohorts revealed increased liver expression of MAPK15 in MASLD patients, compared to unaffected individuals, ultimately supporting a protective role for MAPK15 against this disease. Overall, our data highlight a critical role for MAPK15 in liver physiopathology, by contributing to maintain physiological intracellular levels of lipids in this tissue.",Maria Grazia Andreassi,NDRMGR66P66C349Y

Currently, a growing body of evidence suggests that there exists a mutual crosstalk between telomere dysfunction and mitochondrial dysmetabolism during the process of vascular senescence. This underscores the importance of comprehensively studying the molecular mediators involved in this complex and intricate connection. In pursuit of this goal, the “VICTORIA” protocol entails a prospective single-center cohort study aimed at recruiting patients undergoing coronary angiography at Niguarda Hospital in Italy. The primary objective is to explore potential associations between peripheral markers of cell aging (telomere length and mtDNA content), dysregulation of non-coding RNA [specifically lncRNA TERRA and mitochondrial microRNA (MitomiR)], and the varied presentations of ischemic heart disease (stable angina, unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI). Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether these markers correlate with vulnerable plaque characteristics, as assessed by optical coherence tomography findings. Additionally, systemic levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers and novel indicators of senescence will be assessed. Patients will be followed up at 1 year to monitor primary outcomes including mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, unplanned revascularization, and rehospitalization.

Another pathophysiological mechanism that explains the causal relationship between telomere shortening and atherosclerosis development focuses on the clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which represents a new and independent risk factor in atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Since telomere attrition has a central role in driving vascular senescence, understanding telomere biology is essential to modulate the deleterious consequences of vascular aging and its cardiovascular disease-related manifestations. Emerging evidence indicates that a class of long noncoding RNAs transcribed at telomeres, known as TERRA for “TElomeric Repeat-containing RNA”, actively participates in the mechanisms regulating telomere maintenance and chromosome end protection. However, the multiple biological functions of TERRA remain to be largely elucidated. In particular, the role of TERRA in vascular biology is surprisingly unknown. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge of TERRA and its roles in telomere biology. Additionally, we outline the pieces of evidence that exist regarding the relationship between TERRA dysregulation and disease. Finally, we speculate on how a comprehensive understanding of TERRA transcription in the cardiovascular system may provide valuable insights into telomere-associated vascular aging, offering great potential for new therapeutic approaches.",Maria Grazia Andreassi,NDRMGR66P66C349Y

Background: Italians tend to leave home late, and the age at which young adults leave their parental homes has been rising since the 1980s, raising concerns about shifting demographic patterns and broader societal impacts. Method: Using retrospective data from the ISTAT Multipurpose Survey on Families and Social Subjects (2009 and 2016), we apply event history analysis techniques. Results: The general delay in home-leaving has narrowed parental social class differences among women. However, for men, this delay is concentrated in higher social classes, leading to a widening class gap. Over time, parental social class differences in home-leaving destinations, particularly living with parents, marriage, and autonomy, have generally levelled out. Daughters from higher socioeconomic backgrounds increasingly leave home for education, while cohabitation remains uncommon. Similar trends are observed among men, though sons of agricultural workers have become less likely to stay with their parents and more likely to leave for marriage or autonomy. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the ongoing influence of parental social class on home-leaving destinations, highlighting its continued role in shaping the transition to adulthood in Italy.",Elisa Brini,BRNLSE88P62G843L

Methods We reviewed evidence on lifelong determinants of aging, including physical activity, nutrition, mental engagement, and social participation, alongside emerging digital health solutions. The One Health framework guided our analysis, emphasizing the interconnectedness of individual, societal, and environmental influences. Spoke 4 integrates multidisciplinary expertise to translate scientific knowledge into practical tools for communities, healthcare providers, and policymakers. Results Evidence shows that sustained engagement in physical activity, cognitively stimulating activities, and strong social networks supports resilience, reduces frailty, and preserves independence.

While research explored various behavioral drivers, few studies addressed the conceptual representation of ecological events at different ages. Our preregistered study fills this gap, examining how different generations conceptualize ecology, considering evidence suggesting a link between climate change abstractness and willingness to act pro-environmentally.Older (&gt;65 yo) and younger (18-35 yo) individuals performed multiple tasks targeting conceptual processing (categorization), semantic organization (rating), and conceptual representation (feature generation) of ecological (e.g., deforestation) compared to concrete (e.g., spoon) and abstract (e.g., affirmation) concepts. In the categorization task, participants responded to critical ecological, concrete, and abstract words but refrained from responding to animal words. The rating task involved evaluating critical words on semantic aspects (e.g., Abstractness, Familiarity), and the feature generation task listing properties true for each concept. Innovatively, participants were tested in three possible settings (indoor, natural outdoor, urbanized outdoor) to test whether exposure to nature impacts categorization.Results showed that independent from the setting, ecological concepts were similar to abstract concepts, especially in semantic organization and conceptual representation, or more abstractly characterized than them, especially in conceptual processing. Age differences were minimal, but older adults, who showed more positive attitudes toward ecology and nature, characterized ecological concepts more concretely than younger adults. Theoretically, the multifarious characterization of ecological phenomena supports the flexibility of our conceptual system and points to the necessity of overcoming the classical concrete-abstract dichotomy and studying concepts in a more “situated” manner. From a societal point of view, the age-dependent abstractness of ecological concepts might inform policies on how to improve climate change campaigns, tailoring them for different age groups.",Fabio  Lucidi,LCDFBA65T01Z221G

The present study aims to validate the Subjective Vitality/Depletion Scale (SVDS), an instrument based on this model. A sample of 726 older adults (over 65) from two countries, USA and Italy (M<sub>age</sub> = 72.57, SD<sub>age</sub> = 6.49), completed the SVDS, the Big Five Inventory 2 - Extra Short Form (BFI-2-XS), the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), and the Godin-Shephard Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (GSLTPAQ). Confirmatory factor analyses of the SVDS support the SDT hypothesis that Subjective Vitality and Depletion are two distinct, yet related constructs. Full measurement invariance for the scale was achieved across gender and age subgroups, while partial scalar invariance was established across different countries, suggesting some specific influence of cultural factors. Correlations with BFI-2-XS, SF-12, and GSLTPAQ support the SVDS validity. The study provided evidence that the SVDS based on SDT is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing Subjective Vitality and Depletion among older individuals.",Fabio  Lucidi,LCDFBA65T01Z221G

The present review examines the relationship between PA, motivation and basic psychological needs among older adults aged 65 and over, through the lens of Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Methods Relevant studies that used qualitative methodologies and applied SDT framework were systematically searched in five electronic databases (i.e. Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL). Methodological rigour was assessed using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research). Results 21 studies met inclusion criteria (N = 412; ages 65–97). Four themes and nine subthemes were identified. Peer relationships emerged as a pivotal element in supporting most autonomous forms of motivation and satisfying psychological needs (i.e. autonomy, competence and relatedness). A peer coach was preferred during several health programs, enhancing competence and relatedness. Outdoor activities in natural settings promoted intrinsic motivation, while indoor activities were driven more by extrinsic motivation. Barriers included ageist stereotypes and perceptions of inevitable physical decline, which negatively impacted competence and autonomy, ultimately reducing motivation for PA. Conclusions This qualitative synthesis highlights a complex interplay of SDT components and social factors in influencing PA behaviours among older adults. Tailored interventions that integrate social interaction, provide feedback from coaches and offer choices among several exercises with graduate intensity levels are likely to enhance adherence in PA. Future interventions should address both psychological and social barriers to create inclusive PA strategies that meet older adults’ needs and motivation.",Fabio  Lucidi,LCDFBA65T01Z221G

Previous studies have emphasized the benefits of Physical activity (PA) on cognitive and physical health, especially in late life. Despite the well-established advantages of PA, a substantial portion of the global population remains insufficiently engaged in such activities. In this scenario technologies, such as smartphones, wearable devices, exergaming, and virtual reality, have the potential to promote an active lifestyle. The primary aim of the present systematic review is to summarize the evidence regarding the motivational factors associated with technological devices that lead to an increase in engagement in PA by healthy older adults through different measures of motivation. To further understand the role of technologies, this study considers if the outdoor environment and technology might enhance motivation for PA more effectively than either element alone. Results of the study showed that technologies have shown the potential for increasing PA in this population, activating different motivational dynamics. Moreover, the meta-analysis results showed a small significant effect of technologies on Intrinsic Motivation (i.e., exercising for the inherent enjoyment or satisfaction it provides). However, the included literature has shown major limitations such as a lack of a clear definition of the construct of motivation, the presence of methodological biases, and high heterogeneity.

Among them, the so-called inflammamiRs miR-21-5p, miR-23a-3p, and miR-26a-5p have been repeatedly linked to inflammation, tissue remodelling, and metabolic dysregulation. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated their expression in older adults (65–103 years) to explore associations with frailty, comorbidity, and major clinical and functional indicators of aging. Plasma miRNA levels were measured by quantitative PCR and correlated with comprehensive clinical, functional (frailty status, Activities of Daily Living [ADL], and Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [CIRS]), and biochemical parameters. Bioinformatic pathway analyses were also performed to identify shared molecular targets. All three miRNAs showed a progressive, age-dependent increase in expression. Their associations with clinical and functional parameters remained significant after adjustment for age and sex and were confirmed in stratified analyses by sex, age, and comorbidity burden. miR-21-5p and miR-23a-3p were elevated in frail individuals, and miR-23a-3p was inversely associated with hand grip strength. miR-21-5p correlated with renal dysfunction markers, while miR-26a-5p was related to reduced ADL scores and higher comorbidity burden. Together, the three miRNAs were associated with biochemical indicators of electrolyte imbalance and systemic dysregulation, including anemia and inflammation. In silico analyses revealed convergent enrichment in the TGF-β/SMAD and RUNX1 signaling pathways, suggesting a coordinated regulatory role in inflammation-mediated fibrogenic processes.

Due to these mutations, globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and its deacylated form, globotriaosylsphingosine (lysoGb3), gradually accumulate within the lysosomes of various cells. The potential pathogenicity and clinical relevance of D313Y variation in patients with FD remains debated. D313Y patients do not show clear signs of alpha-galactosidase A deficiency and Gb3 accumulation at an early stage. For this reason, other molecular biomarkers are required for patient risk stratification. The development and application of epigenetic predictors, for healthcare research has grown dramatically over the last decade. These markers also known as epigenetic clocks, can aid FD risk stratification as they resulted to be very accurate for estimating biological age in different diseases. However, data on the epigenetic clock in Fabry disease are still lacking. Our working hypothesis is that the application of epigenetic clocks to quantify the biological age of Fabry patients could provide independent prognostic information for disease risk stratification in patients harboring the D313Y mutation. Therefore, we developed a mathematical model for biological age prediction in healthy individuals and applied it to blood samples from FD patients with the D313Y mutation to identify patterns of accelerated aging. Method The epigenetic clock was developed in a healthy cohort of 201 healthy subjects. FD sample was represented by a cohort including 25 untreated FD patients harboring the D313Y mutation. Genomic DNA from whole blood was extracted using a standard commercial kit. The clock includes five DNAm biomarkers strongly correlated with chronological age (ELOVL2, C1orf132, FHL2, KLF14 and TRIM59). Methylation levels were measured by using a SNaPshot assay and then through the Illumina Methylation EPICv2 Array technology. Results We found a strong correlation between the epigenetic clock and chronological age in DNA samples from healthy subjects (r = 0.97) (Fig. 1). Then, the formulated clock was applied to estimate biological age of patients harboring the D313Y mutation. These patients generally did not show clinical manifestations conformable with FD (enzymatic activity and lyso-Gb3 in plasma within normal limits). 7 patients did not present any sign of disease, 12 neurologic manifestations, 4 renal failure and 2 cerebrovascular events. Surprisingly, the epigenetic age of Fabry patients did not deviate significantly from that of healthy subjects of the same age (Fig. 2). These results were confirmed by epigenetics clocks estimated through EPICv2 methylation assay (Illumina). To further explore the role of the selected epigenetic markers in FD, we analyzed the DNA methylation levels of the 5 genes included in the clock. Only three of these (C1orf132, TRIM59, and KLF14) showed lower age-adjusted methylation levels in FD patients than in healthy subjects (P ≤ 0.001 SNaPshot assay) (Fig. 3). Conclusion To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that an epigenetic clock has been used to FD patient risk stratification. Although a clear direct relationship between epigenetic age and chronological age was not found, we identified epigenetic markers in TRIM59, C1orf132 and KLF14 that might contribute to improving the clinical characterization of FD patients with D313Y mutation.

Church and civil records, dating back to the 16th century, have enabled genealogies and databases to be reconstructed. However, no tools for visually representing AI-based reconstructed pedigrees for entire populations existed. Progeny-AI was developed to bridge this gap. Using AI algorithms, this tool links historical birth, death, and marriage records to reconstruct genealogies and databases. It was applied to a Calabrian municipality with Fabry's disease cases, a Mendelian disorder that is often underdiagnosed. Progeny-AI automatically reconstructed a family of 228 members spanning five generations, going back to the 18th century. This helped identify undiagnosed family members at risk of developing Fabry's disease, enabling earlier diagnosis and better management. Method Data sources and data collection The main data sources used include church and civil status registers (baptism, birth, death, and marriage records) from the area under investigation from 1734 to the present day. The information from these records was first imported into IND-DB, which contains data extracted from birth and death records. Simultaneously, a second database, MAR-DB, containing only marriage data, was created. Data pre-processing, including eliminating spelling errors, duplicates, and typos, improved the quality of databases. Using record-linkage methods, the pedigree generation algorithm processed individual records in IND-DB to reconstruct family trees (Fig. 1). Family tree inference Family trees were inferred by matching information about parents from IND-DB to corresponding marriage records in MAR-DB. A similarity score was calculated for each potential pair of parents. If the score was below a predefined threshold, the search was extended to IND-DB records. In this case, both parents were individually matched, ensuring that their marriage status aligned with the information from the other parent. Matching score A deterministic linkage procedure was used to match records from IND-DB with those in MAR-DB. The process began by estimating matching similarities for multiple candidate marriage records in MAR-DB. Similarity values were calculated using specific measures. For string comparisons (e.g., names, surnames), Jaro-Winkler similarity with a threshold of 0.9 was applied. For numerical data (e.g., ages, distances), a transformed Euclidean distance was used. A family tree of over 11,000 individuals, built by genealogists, served as training data to optimize thresholds and parameters for family tree inference. Implementation Progeny-AI first employs a deterministic data-matching approach implemented in Python. An efficient layout algorithm for drawing and navigating genealogical graphs is then implemented using the Neo4j graph database. Results We reconstructed the entire pedigree and linked most past generations in a large genealogical tree, reaching back to the population of the area under investigation in the mid-1700s. Progeny-AI was also used to infer a genealogical tree starting from a family with several members affected by Fabry's disease (Fig. 2). Progeny-AI enabled rapid reconstruction of a large family, now including 228 individuals with descendants spread across several municipalities of Calabria. Extending the investigation area enabled the identification of potential patients for screening for Fabry's disease. Conclusion Progeny-AI improves genealogical research. While evidence for a founder variant in this region remains to be demonstrated, the results highlight Progeny-AI's relevance in accelerating genetic diagnosis of younger or mildly affected patients, especially those with ancestors from the area under investigation.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

In this study, we investigated the role of genetic variation in the Chromogranin A ( CHGA ) gene, which encodes a multifunctional precursor of regulatory peptides, in human longevity and age-related traits. Using a case-control design with two age cohorts (older adults: 65–85 years; long-lived: 86–107 years), we analysed nine selected CHGA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for associations with survival to advanced age and relevant clinical parameters. Five SNPs (rs9658628, rs9658631, rs9658634, rs7159323, and rs7610) were significantly associated with longevity (FDR q &lt; 0.05). In the older adult cohort, the 5′-UTR rs9658628-A allele was associated to reduced odds of reaching advanced age and correlated with increased insulin resistance (TyG index), type 2 diabetes, and lower cognitive performance (MMSE scores), traits typically linked to higher mortality risk. Paradoxically, this allele was also associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting pleiotropic effects potentially mediated by its regulatory effects on CHGA expression across different tissues. Functional annotation supported rs9658628 as an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for CHGA and neighboring genes ( ITPK1 , FBLN5 genes in particular) in relevant tissues. Additionally, the 3′-UTR rs7610-T allele was associated with both increased diastolic blood pressure and enhanced survival, highlighting the complexity of blood pressure regulation in aging. Although statistical significance for clinical trait associations was lost after FDR correction, these findings suggest that genetic variations in CHGA exert a complex and multifactorial influence on pathways related to metabolism, cognition, and vascular health, with possible consequences for longevity. This intricate pattern could be due to the multiple, sometimes opposing, functions of CHGA and its active fragments. The biological rationale and potential clinical implications of these associations call for further investigation and independent confirmation.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

This study investigated the relationship between BB-DNA and epigenetic, inflammatory, and aging-related markers in 285 elderly both with and without DM2. BB-DNA levels were higher in DM2 patients than in non-diabetic subjects, with the highest levels in those with severe renal impairment. BB-DNA showed a positive association with plasma IL-1β, linking bacterial DNA to systemic inflammation. Epigenetic analysis revealed a negative correlation between BB-DNA and DNA methylation-based leukocyte telomere length, suggesting accelerated aging in DM2. Additionally, BB-DNA was positively associated with DNAm-based biological age estimators, particularly DNAmPhenoAge and DNAmAge Skin Blood Clock. BB-DNA also correlated with DNAmVEGFA and DNAmCystatin C, key markers of diabetic nephropathy and vascular dysfunction. Furthermore, BB-DNA levels were associated with hypomethylation of genes involved in inflammation (e.g., IL1β, TNFα, IFNγ), cellular senescence (p16, p21, TP53), and metabolic regulation (e.g., IGF1, SREBF1, ABCG1, PDK4). These associations suggest that increased BB-DNA may reflect and potentially promote a pro-inflammatory and pro-senescent epigenetic profile in DM2. Importantly, many of these associations remained significant after adjusting for diabetes status, supporting BB-DNA as a robust biomarker across clinical subgroups. These findings provide new insights into the relationship between BB-DNA, inflammation, and epigenetic aging in DM2, highlighting BB-DNA as a potential biomarker for disease progression and complications, particularly in relation to renal dysfunction and systemic inflammation.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

Among the markers included in these clocks, ELOVL2, FHL2, KLF14, C1orf132/MIR29B2C, and TRIM59 resulted to be the most strongly validated markers. We tested the reproducibility and validation of a previously developed targeted epigenetic clock purposely optimized for the measurement of chronological age in blood samples. The clock includes DNAm biomarkers strongly correlated with chronological age whose DNA methylation levels were measured by using a multiplex methylation SNaPshot assay.

While genetics plays a role, the underlying mechanisms remain unsolved. Metallothioneins (MTs), metal-binding proteins with high affinity for zinc, an essential mineral for many physiological functions, are involved in processes including oxidative stress and inflammation. We investigated the impact of genetic variations in MTs on frailty. Methods: 448 subjects (235 females and 213 males, median age of 76 years) were categorized into three frailty groups (non-frail/pre-frail/frail), by hierarchical cluster analysis based on cognitive status (MMSE), functional capacity (ADL), and physical strength (HGS). Subjects were analyzed for selected SNPs in MT1A, MT1B, MT2A, and MT3 genes by PCR-RFLP. Results: An association was found between the rs8052394-A/G (Lys51Arg) polymorphism in the MT1A gene and frailty in females both in binary (OR = 0.345, p = 0.037) and multinomial logistic regression (OR = 0.343, p = 0.036) corrected for age and sex, with carriers of the minor G-allele less likely to transition from non-frail to pre-frail status. Additionally, a significant association with albumin levels (beta = 0.231; p = 0.027) and a trend of association with CRP levels (beta = −1.563; p = 0.097) were observed for this SNP in non-frail females, both indicative of a low inflammatory status. However, Bonferroni correction for multiple SNPs and physiological parameters tested renders these results statistically non-significant. Conclusions: Although its associations do not survive Bonferroni correction, this exploratory study suggests a sex-specific influence of MT1A variability in frailty, likely affecting zinc availability, aligning with ongoing research on sex differences in frailty risk and progression. Larger studies are needed to validate these findings and clarify the mechanisms behind MTs’ variability in frailty progression.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

This study aimed to investigate the effects of ten Essential Oils (EOs) on the activity of nine antibiotics in influencing growth and biofilm formation in Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus faecalis. The effects of the EOs alone and in combination with antibiotics on both bacterial growth and biofilm formation were analyzed by measuring the MIC values through the broth microdilution method and the crystal violet assay, respectively. All EOs inhibited the growth of E. coli (1.25 ≤ MIC ≤ 5 mg/mL) while the growth of P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis was only affected by EOs from Origanum vulgare, (MIC = 5 mg/mL) and O. vulgare (MIC = 1.25 mg/mL) and Salvia rosmarinus (MIC = 5 mg/mL), respectively. In E. coli, most EOs induced a four- to sixteen-fold reduction in the MIC values of ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, gentamicin, and streptomycin, while in E. faecalis such a reduction is observed in combinations of ciprofloxacin with C. nepeta, C. bergamia, C. limon, C. reticulata, and F. vulgare, of gentamicin with O. vulgare, and of tetracycline with C. limon and O. vulgare. A smaller effect was observed in P. aeruginosa, in which only C. bergamia reduced the concentration of tetracycline four-fold. EO-antibiotic combinations also inhibit the biofilm formation. More precisely, all EOs with ciprofloxacin in E. coli, tetracycline in P. aeruginosa, and gentamicin in E. faecalis showed the highest percentage of inhibition. Combinations induce up- and down-methylation of cytosines and adenines compared to EO or antibiotics alone. The study provides evidence about the role of EOs in enhancing the action of antibiotics by influencing key processes involved in resistance mechanisms such as biofilm formation and epigenetic changes. Synergistic interactions should be effectively considered in dealing with pathogenic microorganisms.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

The inability to produce/use adequate renal dopamine may contribute to the development of hypertension and renal dysfunction. The heterodimeric amino acid transporter LAT2/4F2hc ( SLC7A8/SLC3A2 genes) promotes the uptake of L-DOPA, the natural precursor of dopamine. We examined the plausibility that SLC7A8/SLC3A2 gene polymorphisms may contribute to hypertensive CKD by affecting the L-DOPA uptake. Methods 421 subjects (203 men and 218 women, mean age of 78.9 ± 9.6 years) were recruited and divided in four groups according to presence/absence of CKD, defined as reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR 2 ) calculated using the creatinine-based Berlin Initiative Study–1 (BIS1) equation, and to presence/absence of hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg). Subjects were analysed for selected SNPs spanning the SLC7A8 and SLC3A2 loci by Sequenom MassARRAY iPLEX platform. Results The most significant SNP at the SLC3A2 (4F2hc) locus was rs2282477-T/C, with carriers of the C-allele having a lower chance to develop hypertension among CKD affected individuals [OR = 0.33 (CI 0.14–0.82); p = 0.016]. A similar association with hypertensive CKD was found for the SLC7A8 (LAT2) rs3783436-T/C, whose C-allele resulted associated with decreased risk of hypertension among subjects affected by CKD [OR = 0.56 (95% CI 0.35–0.90; p = 0.017]. The two variants were predicted to be potentially functional. Conclusions The association between SLC3A2 and SLC7A8 variants to hypertension development in patients with renal failure could be linked to changes in L-DOPA uptake and consequently dopamine synthesis. Although the associations do not survive correction for Bonferroni multiple testing, and additional research is needed, our study opens new avenues for future basic and translational research in the field of hypertensive CKD.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

Despite progress in HA research, no consensus exists on its constitutive elements, and current frameworks often do not capture its full complexity. Building on the World Health Organization (WHO) HA definition, we organise empirical evidence under three dimensions: intrinsic capacity (IC), functional ability (FA) and the environment (ENV). To identify conceptual, empirical and methodological gaps, we provide a structured synthesis of concepts, measures and instruments used in HA research, evaluating methodological advancement and standardisation in HA measurement. Following PRISMA guidelines, we extract data from 55 quantitative, qualitative and mixed-methods studies with a multidimensional HA focus. We arrange evidence into three primary domains (IC, FA and ENV; first order), 15 sub-domains (second order) and 84 themes (third order). We identify operational categories via thematic analysis and inductively determine the final categorisation, moving from third to first order based on conceptual and measurement considerations. Given the lack of systematic knowledge on ENV, we generate a more nuanced categorisation capturing different levels of analysis and contexts. We compute a mean usage ratio to assess differences in the application of validated tools across HA aspects. The review revealed substantial variability in HA conceptualisation and measurement. IC and FA are the most extensively studied domains, with well-established measurement approaches and widespread use. Common themes include locomotion, cognitive capacities and functional status. ENV remains significantly underexplored and lacks standardised measurement, as mainstream assessments still prioritise deficit-based approaches over enabling environments. This analysis calls for a standardised, multidimensional HA model integrating individual and contextual factors, recognising the role of structural environmental supports in shaping ageing trajectories. Future research should prioritise comprehensive HA measurement and pursue an interdisciplinary approach bridging conceptual and methodological gaps to inform HA policies effectively.",Andreea Alexandra Piriu,PRINRL91L57Z129L

Generally, it is characterized by interstitial pneumonia that can lead to impaired gas-exchange, acute respiratory failure, and death, although a complex disorder of multi-organ dysfunction has also been described. The pathogenesis is complex, and a variable combination of factors has been described in critically ill patients. COVID-19 is a particular risk for older persons, particularly those with frailty and comorbidities. Blood bacterial DNA has been reported in both physiological and pathological conditions and has been associated with some haematological and laboratory parameters but, to date, no study has characterized it in hospitalized old COVID-19 patients The present study aimed to establish an association between blood bacterial DNA (BB-DNA) and clinical severity in old COVID-19 patients. Results BB-DNA levels were determined, by quantitative real-time PCRs targeting the 16S rRNA gene, in 149 hospitalized older patients (age range 65–99 years) with COVID-19. Clinical data, including symptoms and signs of infection, frailty status, and comorbidities, were assessed. BB-DNA was increased in deceased patients compared to discharged ones, and Cox regression analysis confirmed an association between BB-DNA and in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, BB-DNA was positively associated with the neutrophil count and negatively associated with plasma IFN-alpha. Additionally, BB-DNA was associated with diabetes. Conclusions The association of BB-DNA with mortality, immune-inflammatory parameters and diabetes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients suggests its potential role as a biomarker of unfavourable outcomes of the disease, thus it could be proposed as a novel prognostic marker in the assessment of acute COVID-19 disease.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R

Several efforts are underway to counteract the effects of microgravity, and recent studies on irisin, a myokine with anabolic effects on the musculoskeletal system, have shown promising results. Due to the practical challenges of conducting experiments in actual microgravity, different devices generating a simulated microgravity condition on Earth have been developed. Here, we exposed myoblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes to a random position machine (RPM) for five days to assess microgravity effect on the expression of key differentiation factors in cells untreated or treated with irisin. In myoblasts (C2C12), exposure to RPM led to increased expression of early myogenesis maker genes Pax7 ( p = 0.0016), Myf5 ( p = 0.0005) and MyoD ( p = 0.0009). Irisin treatment in the last 8 h of RPM cultures prevented these increases by returning Pax7 ( p = 0.0008) and MyoD ( p = 0.01) to control values, and only partially Myf5 . In bone cells, exposure to RPM for 5 days showed no effect in osteoblasts (MC3T3) but decreased the expression of Pdpn ( p = 0.0285) and Dmp‐1 ( p = 0.0423) genes in osteocytes (MLO‐Y4). Irisin treatment completely prevented the decline in Pdpn ( p = 0.293) and Dmp‐1 ( p = 0.0339) levels. Overall, our data showed that the impact of RPM exposure keeps myoblasts and osteocytes in a proliferative state, and irisin treatment restores them to their baseline biological condition, suggesting that irisin can counteract the changes induced by simulated microgravity.",MANUELA DI CARLO,DCRMNL80C41F376S

Methods Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum irisin levels were evaluated using enzyme‐linked immunoassays in a cohort of subjects with a confirmed biomarker evidence of AD, including AD ( n = 82), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 44), and subjective memory complaint (SMC, n = 20) patients. The results of this analysis were correlated with global cognitive efficiency assessed by Mini‐Mental State Examination, and multidomain cognition evaluated by a battery of psychometric tests. Results Decreased CSF and serum irisin levels were observed in AD and MCI patients compared to SMC. A significant correlation has been found between irisin in the CSF and global cognitive efficiency, as well as with specific cognitive domains such as memory, executive functions, attention, visuospatial abilities, and language.

Antiresorptive molecules represent the main option for the treatment of MM-associated bone disease (MMBD), whereas osteoanabolic molecules are under investigation. Among these latter, we here focused on the myokine irisin, which is able to enhance bone mass in healthy mice, prevent bone loss in osteoporotic mouse models, and accelerate fracture healing in mice. Therefore, we investigated irisin effect on MMBD in a mouse model of MM induced by intratibial injection of myeloma cells followed by weekly administration of 100 μg/kg of recombinant irisin for 5 wk. By micro-Ct analysis, we demonstrated that irisin improves MM-induced trabecular bone damage by partially preventing the reduction of femur Trabecular Bone Volume/Total Volume (P = .0028), Trabecular Number (P = .0076), Trabecular Fractal Dimension (P = .0044), and increasing Trabecular Separation (P = .0003) in MM mice. In cortical bone, irisin downregulates the expression of Sclerostin, a bone formation inhibitor, and RankL, a pro-osteoclastogenic molecule, while in BM it upregulates Opg, an anti-osteoclastogenic cytokine. We found that in the BM tibia of irisin-treated MM mice, the percentage of MM cells displays a reduction trend, while in the femur it decreases significantly. This is in line with the in vitro reduction of myeloma cell viability after 48 h of irisin stimulation at both 200 and 500 ng/mL and, after 72 h already at 100 ng/mL rec-irisin. These results could be due to irisin ability to downregulate the expression of Notch 3, which is important for cell-to-cell communication in the tumor niche, and Cyclin D1, supporting an inhibitory effect of irisin on MM cell proliferation. Overall, our findings suggest that irisin could be a new promising strategy to counteract MMBD and tumor burden in one shot.",MANUELA DI CARLO,DCRMNL80C41F376S

Indeed, this is the case for a plethora of natural media, such as biological tissues and agricultural products, when illuminated by red and near-infrared light. Diffuse Optics (DO) is the branch of Optics that studies how absorption and scattering phenomena affect light propagation in diffusive media. In this review paper, we present an introduction to time domain (TD) DO, a specific implementation of DO that employs picosecond light pulses, fast and sensitive photodetectors and timing electronics to record the distribution of photon time-of-flight (or photon path lengths) in diffusive media. By interpreting the TD DO signals with the physical model provided by the photon diffusion theory, it is possible to estimate the absorption and scattering properties of the medium that in case of biological tissues can be related to physiological and pathological conditions. We focus on the physical principles of TD DO, the building blocks of TD DO instrumentation, and the applications of TD DO targeting human biological tissues (such as the brain, breast, muscle, and others).",Lorenzo Clemente Spinelli,SPNLNZ70B04F205W

We analyzed the convergence properties in various scenarios by numerical methods, trying to derive practical guidelines for the judicious use of this approach, as well as a deeper understanding of the physics behind such relations. In the case of scaling of the absorption coefficient, the convergence is always rigorous both for the forward and inverse problems, relying on the derivatives with respect to the absorption coefficient. Also, the regenerated simulation inherits the very same noise of the original Monte Carlo simulation. In the case of scaling of the scattering coefficient, the situation is more critical. For forward problems, even for just a 10% uniform increase in scattering, appreciable deviations are observed whenever a high number of scattering interactions is involved. We tested a practical criterion based on the number of scattering events in the original simulation to judge the convergence of the scaling factors. For inverse problems, the scaling relations provide accurate regenerated simulations apart from the noise level that is increased with respect to the initial simulation, although anyway lower than the noise level obtained by implementing the direct calculation.

To speed up MC-simulations, scaling relations can be applied to an existing initial MC-simulation to generate a new data-set with different optical properties. We named this approach trajectory-based since it uses the knowledge of the detected photon trajectories of the initial MC-simulation, in opposition to the slower photon-based approach, where a novel MC-simulation is rerun with new optical properties. We investigated the convergence and applicability limits of the scaling relations, both related to the likelihood that the sample of trajectories considered is representative also for the new optical properties. For absorption, the scaling relation contains smoothly converging Lambert-Beer factors, whereas for scattering it is the product of two quickly diverging factors, whose ratio, for NIRS cases, can easily reach ten orders of magnitude. We investigated such instability by studying the probability-distribution for the number of scattering events in trajectories of given length. We propose a convergence test of the scattering scaling relation based on the minimum-maximum number of scattering events in recorded trajectories. We also studied the dependence of MC-simulations on optical properties, most critical in inverse problems, finding that scattering derivatives are ascribed to small deviations in the distribution of scattering events from a Poisson distribution.

There are a series of predefined alternative treatments for each disease and any patient may associate with one of these treatments according to his/her demographics. DTRs for a certain disease are studied and evaluated by means of statistical approaches where patients are randomized at each step of the treatment and their responses are observed. Recently, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm has also been applied to determine DTRs. However, such approaches may be limited by the need to design a true reward function, which may be difficult to formalize when the expert knowledge is not well assessed, as when the DTR is in the design phase. To address this limitation, an extension of the RL paradigm, namely Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), has been adopted to learn the reward function from data, such as those derived from DTR trials. In this paper, we define a Projection Based Inverse Reinforcement Learning (PB-IRL) approach to learn the true underlying reward function for given demonstrations (DTR trials). Such a reward function can be used both to evaluate the set of DTRs determined for a certain disease, as well as to enable an RL-based intelligent agent to self-learn the best way and then act as a decision support system for the clinician.",Giovanni Paragliola,PRGGNN85S19F839Y

This work extends on this point by analysing the consequences of employment instability on (quasi-)completed fertility for men and women in Italy. From a cohort perspective, we look at fertility outcomes at age 41 among those who experienced labour market deregulation (cohorts born between 1966 and 1975) in comparison with the previous cohorts (those born between 1951 and 1965) and relate the fertility outcome to the instability of their employment histories. Based on data from a large-scale, nationally representative retrospective survey, we find that fragmented employment careers and atypical employment periods come with a lower likelihood of ever becoming a parent and a higher probability of having fewer children compared to those with continuous, stable careers. Our study suggests that the consequences of rising labour market instability not only lead to a postponement of childbearing but also lead to overall lower numbers of children, especially for men and younger cohorts. This study adds to previous research by suggesting that recuperation in employment instability-induced childbearing postponement does not take place to a sufficient extent, at least in Italy.",Raffaele Guetto,GTTRFL83M06D969N

We focus on Italy, where persistently low fertility rates are often linked to limited welfare support for families. We surveyed 4,022 respondents aged 20–44 and exposed them to various scenarios characterized by different family policy packages. We asked them to ascribe short-term fertility behavior to a fictitious couple under each scenario. Results show that each family-friendly policy envisioned positively impacts ascribed fertility. The availability of full-time, public childcare services seems more relevant than higher child benefits, whereas more generous and gender-equal parental leaves are perceived as less relevant. However, results suggest that only a consistent mix of financial benefits, parental leave schemes, and childcare provisions can boost fertility. In contrast, marginal changes in single policy levers are most likely ineffective. The FSE reveals that a couple's socioeconomic status is perceived as more important than family policies for fertility: ascribed fertility increases when both partners are employed and household income is high. We conclude by discussing the policy implications of our findings.",Raffaele Guetto,GTTRFL83M06D969N

Public and political debate often frame this so-called «demographic crisis» in reductive terms, attributing declining fertility either to an erosion of traditional family values or to insufficient financial incentives aimed at encouraging childbearing. This article argues that such perspectives are partial and insufficient, failing to capture the deeper structural and institutional determinants underlying Italy’s unmet reproductive potential, which is evidenced by a significant discrepancy between desired and actual fertility, alongside increasing reliance on assisted reproductive technologies. Drawing on a critical review of existing literature, this contribution explores the complex relationship between social policies and fertility in Italy, contrasting pronatalist approaches – which interpret reproductive behavior primarily as individual choices shaped by cultural norms – with structural approaches – which foreground the institutional, economic, and social contexts influencing individual life-courses. Empirical evidence from Italy suggests that isolated pronatalist measures lack efficacy in the absence of comprehensive policies addressing income security, employment stability, housing affordability, gender equality, and work-family reconciliation. While giving some indication for policy development, we argue that promoting fertility should not be framed as a demographic imperative but as a matter of social justice – providing individuals, particularly younger generations, with the supportive structural conditions necessary to realize their life plans, including fertility.",Raffaele Guetto,GTTRFL83M06D969N

Italy’s “lowest-low” fertility regime diverges significantly from the fertility aspirations of individuals, creating a substantial gap between desired and actual fertility—an area ripe for policy intervention. We explore the role of policies in influencing fertility by considering both “pronatalist” measures (e.g., financial incentives, such as baby bonuses or tax breaks) and “structural” approaches (e.g., access to childcare, stable employment, and adequate housing). The chapter reflects on key theoretical and methodological challenges in understanding the policy/fertility relationship and reviews recent empirical evidence specific to Italy. Drawing on well-established micro-level research and findings from experimental studies, our analysis rejects the exclusive reliance on pronatalist policies to address low fertility.

In the framework of the Italian National project Age.It, a pilot study was proposed aiming at the discovery of a molecular signature with predictive potential of carotid stenosis comparing 65+ asymptomatic and symptomatic inpatients. Methods A total of 42 inpatients have been enrolled, including 26 men and 16 women, with a mean age of 74 ± 6 years. Sixteen symptomatic and 26 asymptomatic inpatients with ≥70% carotid stenosis underwent CEA, according to the recommendations of the European Society for Vascular Surgery and the Society for Vascular Surgeons. Plaque biopsies and peripheral blood samples from the same individuals were obtained. Hematobiochemical analyses were conducted on all inpatients, and plasma cytokines/molecules, such as microRNAs (miRs), IL-6, sIL-6Ralpha, sgp130, myostatin (GDF8), follistatin, activin A, CXCL9, FGF21, and fibronectin, were measured using the ELISA standard technique. MiR profiles were obtained in the discovery phase including four symptomatic and four asymptomatic inpatients (both plasma and plaque samples), testing 734 miRs. MiRs emerging from the profiling comparison were validated through RT-qPCR analysis in the total cohort. Results and conclusion The two groups of inpatients differ in the expression levels of blood c-miRs-126–5p and -1271–5p (but not in their plaques), which are more expressed in symptomatic subjects. Three cytokines were significant between the two groups: IL-6, GDF8, and CXCL9. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with a machine learning-based approach, the most significant blood molecular signature encompasses albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), the percentage of monocytes, and CXCL9, allowing for the distinction of the two groups (AUC = 0.83, 95% c.i. [0.85, 0.81], p = 0.0028). The potential of the molecular signature will be tested in a second cohort of monitored patients, allowing the application of a predictive model and the final evaluation of cost/benefit for an assessable screening test.",Miriam Capri,CPRMRM64R63D166U

Empirically, the few studies analysing the relationship between the strictness of employment protection legislation—the norms and procedures regulating labour markets’ hiring and firing processes—and fertility have found mixed evidence. This paper reconciles the ambivalent conclusions of previous studies by analysing the impact of employment protection legislation and labour market dualism on total fertility across 19 European countries between 1990 and 2019. Our results indicate that an increase in employment protection for regular workers positively affects total fertility. Nonetheless, an increasing gap between the regulation of regular and temporary employment—that is, labour market dualism—negatively impacts total fertility. These effects, of small-to-moderate intensity, are relatively homogeneous across age groups and geographical areas and are especially pronounced among the lower educated. We conclude that labour market dualism, rather than a “rigid” employment protection legislation, discourages fertility.",Raffaele Guetto,GTTRFL83M06D969N

A total of 1,001 T2D patients aged more than 70 years were consecutively evaluated by a multidimensional geriatric assessment, including physical performance evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The mortality was assessed during a 5-year follow-up. We used the automatic machine-learning (AutoML) JADBio platform to identify parsimonious mathematical models for risk stratification. Results Of 977 subjects included in the T2D cohort, the mean age was 76.5 (SD: 4.5) years and 454 (46.5%) were men. The mean follow-up time was 53.3 (SD:15.8) months, and 209 (21.4%) patients died by the end of the follow-up.

Epigenetic modifications, in particular DNA methylation, play a crucial role in the aging process, and this parameter has been used to set epigenetic clocks, algorithms that predict an individual’s biological age based on a defined set of CpGs. In this review, we focus on the most recent literature to discuss the use of epigenetic clocks in the context of cognitive decline and dysregulation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-related gene expression. We have summarized all published scientific papers in which epigenetic clocks have been applied to measure age acceleration in blood and brain specimens from patients affected with AD. Progressive age acceleration, consistent with a specific DNA methylation signature, was observed in patients affected by AD, and it was correlated with the onset of complex diseases, mitochondrial alterations, dementia and cognitive decline, even in the early stages of these conditions. The use of epigenetic clocks might be a valuable biomarker to enable an earlier identification of ideal measures to reverse modifications caused by aging and to mitigate multiple aspects of disease/aging mechanisms.",Francesca  Cavalcanti,CVLFNC61T56D086E

Objective The aim of this study was to analyze leukocyte telomeres length (LTL) in FRDA to verify the possible relationships between LTL and disease progression. We investigated LTL in a cohort of FRDA biallelic patients (n = 61), heterozygous (n = 29), and age‐matched healthy subjects (n = 87). Methods LTL was measured by real‐time polymerase chain reaction quantitative analysis (qPCR). Results The results showed that before 35 years of age, leukocyte telomeres were longer in patients than in controls, whereas the reverse applies in patients above 36 years of age. Interestingly, LTL was greater than controls at any age in heterozygous subjects. This picture mirrors what has been previously observed in vitro in FRDA cultured fibroblasts, showing significantly longer telomeres at early passages because of activation of an alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)‐like mechanism, but showing accelerated telomere shortening as population doubling increases. GAA1 repeat length is positively correlated with the LTL and negatively correlated with the age at blood sampling. The relationship of LTL with clinical parameters (cardiomyopathy, diabetes, dependence on a wheelchair) was also analyzed. Significantly shorter leukocyte telomeres were associated with the presence of cardiomyopathy, but not with diabetes and the dependence on a wheelchair. Conclusions Overall, the present study indicates that telomere length analysis in FRDA may be a relevant biomarker for following the stages of the disease. © 2024 The Author(s).

Identifying prognostic biomarkers may improve risk stratification and guide personalized interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term prognostic value of circulating biomarkers related to inflammation, metabolic stress, and organ damage in individuals with T2D. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on a cohort of 478 individuals with T2D, followed for a median of 16.1 years. Ten circulating biomarkers (IL-6, IL-10, CD163, CXCL9, CCL22, GDF15, IL-33, FGF21, Follistatin, and neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were quantified using an automated immunoassay platform. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess their prognostic significance for all-cause mortality. A biomarker-based scoring model was developed by integrating independent predictors of mortality. Predictive performance was evaluated in comparison with the RECODe equation, a validated risk model for diabetes complications and mortality. Results Deceased individuals exhibited significantly higher levels of IL-6, IL-10, CXCL9, FGF21, NfL, and GDF15. Biomarker levels correlated with both microvascular and macrovascular complications, particularly neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, four biomarkers emerged as independent predictors of mortality: CXCL9 (HR per 1 SD increase 1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p = 0.006), GDF15 (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02–1.33, p = 0.032), NfL (HR 1.25, 95% CI 1.09–1.43, p = 0.001), and FGF21 (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04–1.37, p = 0.009).

In 2022, around 1.1 million individuals died from HBV-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Vaccines allow us to save more than 2.5 million lives each year; however, up to 10% of vaccinated individuals may not develop sufficient protective antibody levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the epigenetic drift in the response to HBV vaccine in isolated B cells. Methods: Epigenetic drift was measured by counting rare DNA methylation variants. These epivariants were detected in epigenome-wide data collected from isolated B cell samples from 41 responders and 30 non-responders (age range 22–62 years) to vaccination against HBV. Results: We found an accumulation of epivariants in the NR group, with a significant increase in hyper-methylated aberrations. We identified the chromosomes (1, 3, 11, 12, and 14) and genes (e.g., RUSC1_AS1 or TROVE2) particularly enriched in epivariants in NRs. The literature search and pathway analysis indicate that such genes are involved in the correct functioning of the immune system. Moreover, we observed a correlation between epigenetic drift and DNA methylation entropy in the male population of the cohort. Finally, we confirmed the correlation between epivariant loads and age-related epigenetic clocks. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that an age-related derangement of the epigenetic architecture is involved in unresponsiveness to the HBV vaccine. Furthermore, the overall results highlight the interconnection between various epigenetic dynamics (such as drift, clocks, and entropy), although these interconnections seem not to be involved in the altered immunological activity.",Stefano  Salvioli,SLVSFN66D16B819H

Notably, about 5–10% of the general population does not respond to the HBV vaccination. In this study, we aimed to investigate DNA methylation (DNAm) in order to estimate the biological age of B cells from HCW of both sexes, either responder (R) or non-responder (NR), to HBV vaccination. We used genome-wide DNA methylation data to calculate a set of biomarkers in B cells collected from 41 Rs and 30 NRs between 22 and 62 years old. Unresponsiveness to HBV vaccination was associated with accelerated epigenetic aging (DNAmAge, AltumAge, DunedinPoAm) and was accompanied by epigenetic drift. Female non-responders had higher estimates of telomere length and lower CRP inflammation risk score when compared to responders. Overall, epigenetic differences between responders and non-responders were more evident in females than males. In this study we demonstrated that several methylation DNAm-based clocks and biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of non-response to HBV vaccination, particularly in females. Based on these results, we propose that accelerated epigenetic age could contribute to vaccine unresponsiveness. These insights may help improve the evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination strategies, especially among HCWs and vulnerable patients.",Stefano  Salvioli,SLVSFN66D16B819H

However, the use of circulating GDF15 (c-GDF15) as a biomarker of sarcopenia is still debated. Moreover, the role of GDF15 intracellular precursor, pro-GDF15, in human skeletal muscle (SM-GDF15) is not totally understood. In order to clarify these points, the association of both forms of GDF15 with parameters of muscle strength, body composition, metabolism and inflammation was investigated. Methods the levels of c-GDF15 and SM-GDF15 were evaluated in plasma and muscle biopsies, respectively, of healthy subjects (HS) and patients with lower limb mobility impairment (LLMI), either young (&lt;40 years-old) or old (&gt;70 years-old). Other parameters included in the analysis were Isometric Quadriceps Strength (IQS), BMI, lean and fat mass percentage, Vastus lateralis thickness, as well as circulating levels of Adiponectin, Leptin, Resistin, IGF-1, Insulin, IL6, IL15 and c-PLIN2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) and Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis were performed. Results c-GDF15 but not SM-GDF15 levels resulted associated with decreased IQS and IGF-1 levels in both HS and LLMI, while only in LLMI associated with increased levels of Resistin. Moreover, in LLMI both c-GDF15 and SM-GDF15 levels were associated with IL-6 levels, but interestingly SM-GDF15 is lower in LLMI with respect to HS. Furthermore, a discrimination of the four groups of subjects based on these parameters was possible with PCA and CDA. In particular HS, LLMI over 70 years or under 40 years of age were discriminated based on SM-GDF15, c-GDF15 and Insulin levels, respectively. Conclusion our data support the idea that c-GDF15 level could be used as a biomarker of decreased muscle mass and strength. Moreover, it is suggested that c-GDF15 has a different diagnostic significance with respect to SM-GDF15, which is likely linked to a healthy and active state.",Stefano  Salvioli,SLVSFN66D16B819H

Recently, a role for PLIN2 in supporting mitochondrial function has emerged. PLIN2 dysregulation is involved in many metabolic disorders and age‐related diseases. However, the exact consequences of PLIN2 dysregulation are not yet completely understood. In this study, we knocked down (KD) PLIN2 in primary human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) from young (mean age 29 years) and old (mean age 71 years) healthy donors. We have found that PLIN2 KD caused a decline of mitochondrial function only in hDFs from young donors, while mitochondria of hDFs from old donors (that are already partially impaired) did not significantly worsen upon PLIN2 KD. This mitochondrial impairment is associated with the increased expression of the stress‐related mitokine growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and the induction of cell senescence. Interestingly, the simultaneous KD of PLIN2 and GDF15 abrogated the induction of cell senescence, suggesting that the increase in GDF15 is the mediator of this phenomenon. Moreover, GDF15 KD caused a profound alteration of gene expression, as observed by RNA‐Seq analysis. After a more stringent analysis, this alteration remained statistically significant only in hDFs from young subjects, further supporting the idea that cells from old and young donors react differently when undergoing manipulation of either PLIN2 or GDF15 genes, with the latter being likely a downstream mediator of the former.",Stefano  Salvioli,SLVSFN66D16B819H

The intervention model integrates physical, cognitive, nutritional, and psychosocial components, supported by digital tools, biomarkers of aging, and a centralized data platform. Results The project is expected to generate evidence on the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of multidomain interventions implemented across diverse real-world settings, including community, hospital, and long-term care. Technology-assisted strategies—such as wearable sensors and digital cognitive tools—may enhance adherence and enable remote monitoring, while also supporting more personalized care delivery. The integration of artificial intelligence will facilitate the interpretation of complex clinical and biological data, improving risk stratification and the early identification of individuals most likely to benefit from targeted interventions. Together, these approaches may help reduce hospitalizations, delay functional decline, and promote aging in place. Discussion This initiative supports the transition toward more integrated and equitable care models for older adults.

As an empirical application, we examine its distribution in Italy and we study its relationship with subjective well-being across family types, for the period 2004–2020, drawing on data from the Bank of Italy’s Survey on Household Income and Wealth. Our results show two key findings. First, the descriptive analysis illustrates an overall increase in housing insecurity prevalence, with a slight decline after 2012. Nonetheless, although the number of housing insecure families decreases after 2012, those who remain affected experience heightened levels of housing insecurity. Second, we detect a negative, significant and sizeable relationship between housing insecurity and subjective well-being. Across family types, we find housing insecurity to be negatively associated with subjective well-being especially for couples with children and for single parents.",Andrea Ballerini,BLLNDR98T09D612K

Despite the recognised role of the activin pathway in pulmonary vascular remodelling, its involvement in CTEPH remains insufficiently explored. This study aimed to investigate the presence of activin pathway components in CTEPH-related microvasculopathy and evaluate their potential as biomarkers. Methods Plasma levels of activin pathway biomarkers and key inflammatory mediators were assessed in controls and operable CTEPH patients pre- and post-surgery. The study enrolled 69 patients (mean age 62±13 years, 51% male), among whom 29 exhibited residual pulmonary hypertension (PH) after surgery, and two died following post-endarterectomy (PEA). Results CTEPH patients demonstrated elevated levels of activin-A, activin-B, FSTL3, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), β-nerve growth factor, C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-brain natriuretic peptide (compared to controls). Pre-operative activin-A levels were associated with an increased risk of residual PH or mortality post-surgery (odds ratio 2.469, 95% CI 1.011–5.487; p=0.027), following adjustments for age, mean pulmonary arterial pressure before PEA, and CRP. Histological analysis of lung specimens from CTEPH patients revealed nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated Smad 2 and upregulation of inhibin-βA, inhibin-βB, activin receptor type IIB (ACTRIIB) and FSTL3 in muscularised pulmonary arterioles. Conclusions These findings suggest a potential role for activin-A as a predictive biomarker for residual PH following pulmonary endarterectomy in CTEPH. Further investigation into the activin pathway may uncover therapeutic targets for managing CTEPH-associated vascular remodelling.",Alessandra Cuomo,CMULSN91P66F839H

Methods: A total of 108 consecutive patients (mean age 73.55 ± 5.43 years old; 40.7% females) referred to our cardio-oncology unit were enrolled, and three different groups were identified: Group 1, patients naïve for oncologic treatments (mean age 73.32 ± 5.40; 33% females); Group 2, patients already on antineoplastic protocols (mean age 73.46 ± 5.09; 44.1% females); and Group 3, patients who had already completed cancer treatments (mean age 74.34 ± 6.23; 55% female). The correlation between CGA, performed in a subgroup of 62 patients (57.4%), and echocardiographic parameters was assessed. Results: Group 2 patients had the highest incidence of CV events (CVEs) (61.8% vs. 14.8% in Group 1, 15% in Group 3; p ≤ 0.001) and withdrawals from oncologic treatments (8.8% vs. none in Group 1; p = 0.035). Group 2 had worse 48-month survival (47.1% vs. 22.2% in Group 1, 20% in Group 3; p = 0.05), which was even more evident when focusing on patients who died during follow-up. When assessing echocardiographic parameters, physical activity showed an inverse correlation with the left ventricular mass index (p = 0.034), while the Frailty index showed a direct correlation with the E/e’ ratio (p = 0.005). Conclusions: A thorough baseline CV assessment is important in elderly oncologic patients eligible for anticancer treatment.

Functional capacity measured with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is extensively studied in patients with cardiovascular diseases. In the current prospective study, we aim at exploring the role of CPET in oncologic patients and at evaluating exercise capacity and its variation with the administration of oncologic treatments. Material and methods. We analyzed 77 maximal CPETs from older adult cancer patients and assessed exercise capacity. CPETs were performed before starting (t0), during (t1) and at the end of (t2) oncologic treatments. The main outcome was death for all causes. Results. CPETs performed at t0 and t1 showed a reduced percent predicted peak VO2, compared to CPETs performed at t2. In addition, at t2 we observed higher peak achieved workload and longer exercise time compared to t0 and t1. Intriguingly, achieved workload and oxygen uptake at Anaerobic Threshold were lowest in CPETs performed at t1, while Respiratory Exchange Ratio (RER) was higher in t1. Predicted Vo2/HR and oxygen pulse (Vo2/HR), were higher after therapy and lower during oncologic treatments. These abnormalities were even more evident in CPETs of patients who underwent anthracyclines-based treatments, and when comparing patients who then died later during follow-up (G1) vs patients who survived (G2). Conclusions. CPET can be useful to evaluate exercise capacity and muscular metabolic alterations in older adult cancer patients. The effectiveness of this technology in predicting survival or the increased incidence of cardiovascular events in cancer patients is not fully understood; further studies are needed to define the role of CPET in assessing the benefits of aerobic exercise and its potential “therapeutic” prescription in cancer patients.",Alessandra Cuomo,CMULSN91P66F839H

Methods and results We enrolled 231 consecutive patients referred to our Cardio‐Oncology unit from January 2015 to February 2020. Three different types were identified, according to their chemotherapeutic statuses at first visit. Type 1 included patients naïve for oncological treatments, Type 2 patients already being treated with oncological treatments, and Type 3 patients who had already completed cancer treatments. Type 2 patients presented the highest incidence of cardiovascular events (46.2% vs. 12.3% in Type 1 and 17.9% in Type 3) and withdrawals from oncological treatments (5.1% vs. none in Type 1) during the observation period. Type 2 patients presented significantly worse 48 month‐survival (32.1% vs. 16.7% in Type 1 and 17.9% in Type 3), and this was more evident when in the three groups we focused on patients with uncontrolled cardiovascular risk factors or overt cardiovascular disease at the first cardiologic assessment.

The causes, clinical burden and outcomes of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) remain poorly characterised. The aim of this study was to describe patient characteristics, causes of ICU hospitalisation, and risk factors for ICU and 1-year mortality. Methods Data from patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins Pulmonary Hypertension Registry were analysed for the period between January 2010 and December 2020. Clinical, functional, haemodynamic and laboratory data were collected. Measurements and main results 102 adult patients with 155 consecutive ICU hospitalisations were included. The leading causes for admission were right heart failure (RHF, 53.3%), infection (17.4%) and arrhythmia (11.0%). ICU mortality was 27.1%. Mortality risk factors included Na −1 (OR: 3.10, 95% CI: 1.41–6.82), elevated pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) (OR: 1.75, 95% CI: 1.03–2.98), hyperbilirubinaemia (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.09–1.80), hyperlactaemia (OR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.05–1.93), and need for vasopressors/inotropes (OR: 5.29, 95% CI: 2.28–12.28), mechanical ventilation (OR: 3.76, 95% CI: 1.63–8.76) and renal replacement therapy (OR: 5.57, 95% CI: 1.25–24.76).

Digital health solutions offer potential for improving self-management, but a structured methodology to translate the complex unmet needs of this population into tailored digital interventions is still lacking. Objectives To propose and illustrate a mixed-methods, persona-based approach for mapping unmet needs of older adults with multimorbidity to candidate digital interventions. Methods This study employed an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. First, quantitative data from the SUNFRAIL+ frailty screening tool were analyzed for a sub-cohort of community-dwelling older adults with polypharmacy ( n = 54). These findings informed a qualitative phase conducted through a multidisciplinary Focus Group (FG) of 15 healthcare and social care experts. FG transcripts were thematically analyzed to identify unmet needs across clinical, psychological, social, and environmental domains. These insights were synthesized using the European Commission’s Blueprint methodology to create a realistic persona, “Gennaro,” representing common challenges. Finally, the FG systematically mapped potential digital solutions to address the identified needs. We descriptively profiled a polypharmacy subgroup ( n = 54) from the F2UH site of the multicentre SUNFRAIL+ study; no hypothesis testing was performed. Results SUNFRAIL+ data revealed a high prevalence of perceived memory loss (44.4%), reduced physical activity (40.7%), loneliness (29.6%), and gaps in primary care access (25.9%). Thematic analysis highlighted unmet needs in medication management, motivation for lifestyle change, social isolation, and environmental barriers. The persona “Gennaro” embodied these challenges, facilitating the identification of targeted digital solutions, including Shared Care Plans, Telemonitoring, smart pillboxes for Medication Adherence, Adapted Physical Activity programs, Motivational Interviewing apps, and Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems. A foundational dataset and interoperability requirements for implementation were also defined. Conclusion This descriptive, hypothesis-generating study integrates quantitative screening and multidisciplinary expert insights to propose a structured, persona-guided approach for profiling the multifaceted unmet needs of older adults with multimorbidity. We outline candidate digital options mapped to specific challenges as a preliminary framework to hypothesize person-centered, digitally supported care models. End-user co-design and validation are planned next to evaluate feasibility, usability, acceptability, and potential impact on self-management and adherence.",Alessandra Cuomo,CMULSN91P66F839H

Self-care is crucial for managing NCDs, yet older adults often struggle to engage in these behaviors. Psychological factors like personal Views on Aging (VoA) and Illness Perceptions (IP) influence health behaviors, but their role in Self-Care Maintenance (SCM) remains underexplored. This cross-sectional study examined the associations among IP, Awareness of Age-Related Changes (AARC) as a measure of VoA, and SCM in older adults with NCDs. Findings revealed that negative IP were associated with higher AARC-Losses and lower SCM. Higher AARC-Gains were associated with higher SCM, whereas the negative association between AARC-Losses and SCM approached significance. Furthermore, independent of sociodemographic characteristics and number of NCDs, AARC-Gains and AARC-Losses were positively and negatively associated with SCM, respectively. These results suggest that incorporating VoA into self-care interventions could enhance patient engagement, autonomy, and quality of life.

Regular exercise can improve physical performance and quality of life, reduce the risks of falls and depressive symptoms, and reduce the likelihood of cognitive decline in older adults. Virtual reality (VR) and serious games (SG) are promising tools to improve physical and cognitive functioning. As part of the VR2Care project activities, four pilot sites explored the capabilities of the VR environment in a remote psychomotor training with SG and a hybrid approach with local groups of older adults performing physical activity. Objective The present study aimed to explore and measure the impact on older adults’ quality of life and physical activity of using VR2Care solution and the level of usability, satisfaction and acceptance. Methods The study is a mixed method study, using qualitative and quantitative surveys to evaluate quality of life and physical activity of older users, and usability, satisfaction and acceptance of the solution. The data collection is a mix of investigator site data entry and users’ self-reported data through the solutions or through online and paper-based means. Data were collected at baseline and after a follow-up of 6 weeks. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise stated. Within the group, baseline to end of observation differences were assessed by paired sample t-test. A p = 0.05 was considered significant. Results No significant improvements in quality of life and physical activity were found. Little improvement, although not significant, in physical activity was found, comparing the Total MET average value of users who participated in phase I and II, therefore using SmartAL and Rehability. Little improvement, although not significant, in physical activity applies in ≥76 population. Users’ feedback on usability, satisfaction and acceptance of VR2Care is generally positive. VR2Care was appreciated mostly for its usefulness in managing physical activity and the capacity to influence the consistency of attending physical activity sessions as prescribed by doctors.

The multipopulation Lee-Carter family of models, a widely-used methodology, decompose mortality rates into age, time, and country components, offering valuable insights into mortality trends. We delve into the interpretability of the Lee-Carter multipopulation model, elucidating its ability to capture underlying mortality patterns and project future trajectories. Moreover, we extend our analysis by incorporating machine learning techniques to model the residuals of the Lee-Carter framework. The main contribution of the paper is to introduce these techniques in the context of the multiple population mortality models. Specifically, we employ Random Forest to refine joint mortality forecasts by country, effectively capturing complex nonlinear relationships in residuals and improving predictive performance. In this paper, we revisit these models using new statistical techniques and data sets from the Human Mortality Database. By leveraging advanced computational algorithms, we aim to enhance the accuracy of mortality rate predictions and account for residual patterns that may not be captured by the traditional Lee-Carter approach alone. Through empirical validation and comparative analyses, we demonstrate the efficacy of integrating machine learning into multiple population mortality forecasting, thereby contributing to the refinement and improvement of mortality modeling methodologies.",Gabriella Piscopo,PSCGRL83H56F839C

The growth of life expectancy in industrialized countries, the inadequacy of pension systems and the high medical costs shed light on the need to provide adequate solutions for retirees, whose wealth is mostly illiquid and mainly composed by own home. The reverse mortgage (RM) contract allows elder homeowners to borrow money using their home as asset for the loan, maintaining the right to live in the house. The debt is repaid by the heirs when the borrower dies. This contract might constitute a valid support for the spending needs that may arise during retirement. The paper deals with a decision problem of a homeowner who is approaching old age and has to evaluate contracting a reverse mortgage or not. In order to investigate the economic effects of RM on elderly’s consumption behavior, we construct a life cycle model tailored to “house rich and cash poor” individuals, whose primary wealth asset is constituted by real estate and who has to deal with the uncertainty about lifespan, future health states and the consequent considerable expenses for medical treatments, as well as house maintenance costs. Elders’ lifetime utility functions take into account consumption preferences, lifespan uncertainty and bequest motivations, in order to capture the impact of the attachment to the property on elder’s financial planning. We solve the optimization problem to find the optimal savings allocation, with and without RM. We present three exemplary cases related to different occurrences of health status, focusing on Italian retired males. Through our analysis, we found out that, in presence of long-term care expenses and house maintenance costs, individual’s liquid wealth significantly increases with reverse mortgage. Moreover, homeowner with a higher bequest motivation experiences lower utility gains from contracting RM plan. Our results provide an alternative tool to explain elderly skepticism in buying this kind of product.",Gabriella Piscopo,PSCGRL83H56F839C

In accordance with regulatory guidelines that direct prudent assessments of future losses to ensure solvency, within the perspective of the risk assessment of Reverse Mortgage portfolios, the paper deals with the estimation of the Conditional Value at Risk.

Among the tested PFs, xanthohumol (XN), isoxanthohumol (IXN) and 8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN), XN exhibited the strongest anti-amyloidogenic activity, inhibiting Aβ1-42 aggregation at substoichiometric concentrations and stabilizing the peptide in amorphous aggregates. Its higher conformational flexibility drives the distinct interaction profile and protective effect; in fact, XN forms stable complexes with Aβ1-42 oligomers, preventing their transition to β-sheet-rich fibrils. These findings highlight that XN may offer a neuroprotective strategy by redirecting Aβ1-42 aggregation toward less toxic species, in agreement with its previously described ability to reduce Aβ toxicity. Our data dissect the anti-amyloidogenic mechanism of action of XN at molecular level, providing structural insights for the rational design of a new class of Aβ inhibitors. Indeed, conventional drug discovery approaches are often ineffective against amyloid aggregates, due to their dynamic and atypical receptor structures. Instead, preventive and therapeutic strategies should focus on compounds that form stable supramolecular complexes, capable of modulating the structure and toxicity of the aggregates without relying on specific binding sites. Additionally, due also to its anti-oxidant activity, XN, naturally present in hops, shows promise as nutraceutical for Alzheimer's disease prevention. Dietary supplementation with XN could modulate early molecular events linked to neurodegeneration, providing a safe, sustainable approach to neuroprotection.",Antonino Natalello,NTLNNN77E24A089H

Within this study, we will explore a comprehensive array of established and exploratory blood biomarkers of several pathologic age-related processes, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neurodegeneration, inflammation, senescence and sarcopenia, to stratify subject risk and assess the effect of multidomain interventions on biomarkers. Design and participants ApoE4 status and plasma p-tau217 (AD), NfL (neurodegeneration), GFAP and IL-6 (inflammation), GDF-15 (senescence/sarcopenia) will be evaluated in all subjects ( n = 1,662) both at the baseline and at the end of the study (12 months).

Forty-three patients (7 SCD, 27 MCI, and 9 AD) underwent a follow-up (FU) visit after 2 years, and a second plasma sample was collected. Plasma biomarker levels were detected using the Simoa SR-X technology (Quanterix Corp.). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software version 28 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results GFAP, NfL and pTau 181 levels in plasma were lower in SCD and MCI than in AD patients. In particular, plasma GFAP levels were statistically significant different between SCD and AD ( p =0.003), and between MCI and AD ( p =0.032). Plasma NfL was different in SCD vs MCI ( p =0.026), SCD vs AD ( p &lt;0.001), SCD vs AD FU ( p &lt;0.001), SCD FU vs AD ( p=0.033 ), SCD FU vs AD FU ( p=0.011 ), MCI vs AD ( p =0.002), MCI FU vs AD ( p =0.003), MCI FU vs AD FU ( p =0.003) and MCI vs AD FU ( p =0.003). Plasma pTau 181 concentration was significantly different between SCD and AD ( p =0.001), MCI and AD ( p =0.026), MCI FU and AD ( p =0.020). In APOE ϵ4 carriers, a statistically significant increase in plasma NfL ( p&lt;0.001 ) and pTau 181 levels was found ( p=0.014). Moreover, an association emerged between age at disease onset and plasma GFAP (p = 0.021) and pTau181 (p &lt; 0.001) levels. Discussion and conclusions Plasma GFAP, NfL and pTau 181 are promising biomarkers in the diagnosis of the prodromic stages and prognosis of dementia.",Benedetta Nacmias,NCMBDT60S58D612M

Population aging and the consequential increase in the proportion of elderly, are making frailty a public health priority, especially in the European Union, where the proportion of elderly is projected to increase significantly in the next 30 years. Despite the numerous studies on frailty and its determinants, scholarly interest towards the role of the social determinants, specifically, is recent, with most studies focusing on the Asian context. Thus, evidence on the social determinants of frailty in the European context is scarce. In light of this, the study we propose aims at evaluating the role of social connectedness and activity participation on frailty among the elderly in Europe, using suitable regression techniques. We employ data from the Survey on Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), providing information on the health, socioeconomic conditions and social life of community-dwelling individuals aged 50 or older in European countries. Specifically, we study how social networks (SN) and activity participation (AP) in wave 4 affect frailty of people aged 60 and over in wave 5 by gender, separately. We measure SN and AP via two indexes proposed in the literature. To measure frailty, we rely on Romero-Ortuno et al.’s SHARE Frailty Instrument, providing pre-calculated, population-representative and gender-specific frailty indexes. Our findings hint at the existence of a substantial association between both social connectedness and activity participation and frailty. However, this association appears to change across genders. When comparing the role of social connectedness and activity participation, a more prominent association with activity participation emerges.",Rosella Rettaroli,RTTRLL58E55E388D

Dysregulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs)-the enzymes catalyzing this process-has been implicated in a wide spectrum of chronic conditions, including cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that food-derived bioactive compounds can act as DNMT inhibitors, reshaping epigenetic landscapes. This systematic review, registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022320316), critically evaluated in vitro, in vivo animal, and ex vivo studies investigating the effects of dietary bioactives on DNMT expression and activity. A thorough search of PubMed up to 23 May, 2025, yielded 103 studies, of which 76 met the inclusion criteria. Eligible publications were original, peer-reviewed, and provided evidence from in vitro, in vivo animal, or ex vivo models. Frequently studied bioactives included epigallocatechin-3-gallate, curcumin, genistein, resveratrol, sulforaphane, and folate. Notably, nearly 90% of studies reported DNMT inhibition-often dose- and time-dependent. Approximately 21% defined minimal effective concentrations, predominantly for isolated compounds. Several studies described synergistic interactions between bioactives, and emerging data highlighted the gut microbiota's mediating role in epigenetic modulation. Despite promising outcomes, the predominance of preclinical evidence and variability in experimental protocols and dosing limit the immediate translational impact. Nonetheless, current findings underscore the promise of dietary DNMT modulators as foundational elements for precision nutrition strategies aimed at promoting healthy aging and mitigating age-associated disease risk. The potential application of DNA methylation age as a biomarker of biological aging has been increasingly supported by recent literature, reinforcing its relevance in future nutritional epigenetics research. Further well-designed clinical trials are warranted to assess long-term efficacy, safety, and bioavailability of these compounds and to validate their use in personalized epigenetic interventions using biological aging markers.

In vitro analyses revealed the extract’s strong antioxidant activity, ability to reduce telomere shortening, and capacity to protect against DNA damage, thereby decreasing cellular senescence and improving endothelial function. The randomized, double-blind clinical trial demonstrated that daily oral supplementation with the extract significantly improved leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and stabilized DNA methylation age (DNAmAge) in the intervention group, while the placebo group experienced accelerated epigenetic aging and hypermethylation of critical age-related genes (ELOVL2 and FHL2). The intervention group also reported enhanced quality of life, particularly in the physical domain, along with improved movement and quality sleep indices detected by questionnaire and wearable sensors.

RNA editing has a plethora of biological functions, and its deregulation has been associated with various human disorders. While the large-scale detection of A-to-I is quite straightforward using the Illumina RNAseq technology, the identification of C-to-U events is a non-trivial task. This difficulty arises from the rarity of such events in eukaryotic genomes and the challenge of distinguishing them from background noise. Direct RNA sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) permits the direct detection of Us on sequenced RNA reads. Surprisingly, using ONT reads from wild-type (WT) and APOBEC1-knock-out (KO) murine cell lines as well as in vitro synthesized RNA without any modification, we identified a systematic error affecting the accuracy of the Cs call, thereby leading to incorrect identifications of C-to-U events. To overcome this issue in direct RNA reads, here we introduce a novel machine learning strategy based on the isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm in which C-to-U editing events are considered as sequencing anomalies. Using in vitro synthesized and human ONT reads, our model optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio improving the detection of C-to-U editing sites with high accuracy, over 90% in all samples tested. Our results suggest that iForest, known for its rapid implementation and minimal memory requirements, is a promising tool to denoise ONT reads and reliably identify RNA modifications.",ADRIANO FONZINO,FNZDRN87P17L049B

The available sequencing technologies only allow to indirectly deduce the genomic location of rNMPs. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) may overcome such limitation, revealing the sites of rNMPs incorporation in genomic DNA directly from raw sequencing signals. We synthesized two types of DNA molecules containing rNMPs at known or random positions and we developed data analysis pipelines for DNA-embedded ribonucleotides detection by ONT. We report that ONT can identify all four ribonucleotides incorporated in DNA by capturing rNMPs-specific alterations in nucleotide alignment features, current intensity, and dwell time.

NMSCs incidence increases with age, and as the worldwide population is constantly ageing, the management of patients with NMSCs poses a considerable burden on healthcare systems. This study aimed to identify key digital solutions addressing the unmet needs of individuals with a NMSCs profile, through an adaptation of the “Blueprint on Digital Transformation in Health and Care in an Ageing Society” (Blueprint) user-centred design methodology. A phone survey was administered to 87 patients treated at the Plastic Surgery Unit of Federico II University Hospital from 2022 to 2023, to analyse the demographic, clinical and social characteristics of NMSCs patients. The theoretical elaboration of NMSCs personas was developed by an interdisciplinary Focus Group (FG). Seventy patients agreed to participate in the survey when contacted by phone, 55% were males. Only 4 patients had primary education. 52 patients (74%) had BCC, and 18 patients (26%) presented SCC. Most frequently referred comorbidities were diabetes (17%), hypertension (28%), overweight (41%) and obesity (13%). Patients’ primary concern was the possible need for extended hospitalization and not having easily accessible information and medical assistance. 92% of our patients declared that they could rely on someone to assist them in using a smartphone or a tablet. The FG elaborated a “Persona” named Pino, a 67-year-old retired man living in the suburban Neapolitan area. He suffers from diabetes and hypertension. Pino is also overweight, smokes a few cigarettes a day and occasionally drinks wine or spirits. He has a diagnosis of an invasive basal cell carcinoma of the scalp. Pino has trouble keeping track of all the preoperative and postoperative prescriptions and would like to have direct contact with the healthcare practitioners. He has difficulties adhering to his therapy. Pino is unable to reproduce postoperative dressings correctly. The digital solution proposed by the FG is a mHealth solution that supports the patient with a shared digital calendar for medical appointments, connected to a smart pillbox. The solution must support patients through a digital education package that includes tutorials on dressing and dressing prescriptions. An AI-supported chatbot would allow patients to quickly access the information they need. The Blueprint “Persona” methodology is a powerful tool to help healthcare professionals identify the unmet needs of specific patient subsets. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the actual feasibility of implementing therapeutic pathways for patients with NMSCs through mHealth solutions.",ANNACHIARA  CAVALIERE,CVLNCH92C66F839W

This article examines how dissemination and participatory strategies can bridge research and practice, drawing on the Age-It Research Program—one of Europe’s largest transdisciplinary initiatives on aging. Methods Age-It involves 1,000+ researchers across 10 “Spokes” and several cross-cutting Boards, engaging more than 100 stakeholder organizations. We describe the overarching dissemination and co-creation strategy developed by the Stakeholders and Dissemination Board, acknowledging the diverse participatory practices within Spokes. We term our approach incremental participatory, recognizing both early stakeholder involvement and the practical constraints of coordinating a program of this scale. Results Our experience highlights three key lessons. First, establishing a shared language, timeframe, and platform is essential for transdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement. Second, dissemination and knowledge mobilization must be embedded throughout the research process rather than treated as a final stage activity, combining digital tools (e.g., WikiAge-It, the Age-It Dashboard) with offline, community-based events to foster inclusive participation. Third, while co-creation enhances legitimacy and relevance, sustaining active engagement requires significant investments in resources, infrastructures, and facilitation processes. Discussion By integrating participatory research principles with implementation science frameworks, Age-It demonstrates how structured collaboration and knowledge mobilization can support evidence-based policies and practices. However, challenges remain, including uneven stakeholder engagement, time constraints, and the difficulty of translating complex scientific insights into actionable formats. We conclude that dissemination and participatory approaches in aging research must be seen as dynamic, iterative, and resource-intensive processes.",Navid Nobani,NBNNVD87P21Z224J

The structural and chemical properties of the Al1−xScxN films were studied by x-ray diffraction and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry techniques, respectively. The piezoelectric response was investigated by piezoresponse force microscopy. In addition, the surface potential was evaluated for the first time for Sc-doped AlN thin films by Kelvin probe force microscopy, providing piezoelectric coefficients free from the no-piezoelectric additional effect to the mechanical deformation, i.e., the electrostatic force. By alloying AlN with scandium, the piezoelectric response was strongly enhanced (up to 200% compared to undoped AlN), despite the low deposition temperature and the absence of any other additional energy source supplied to the adatoms during thin film growth, which generally promotes a better structural arrangement of polycrystalline film.

In particular, the fit-for-purpose microfluidic devices called organ-on-chip (OoC), which host living engineered organs that mimic in vivo conditions, benefit greatly from the integration of sensors, enabling the monitoring of specific chemical-physical parameters that can be correlated with biological processes. In this context, copper is an essential trace element whose total concentration may be associated with specific pathologies, and it is therefore important to develop reliable analytical techniques in cell systems. Copper can be determined by using the anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV) technique, but its applicability in cell culture media presents several challenges. Therefore, in this work, the performance of ASV in cell culture media was evaluated, and an acidification protocol was tested to improve the voltammetric signal intensity. A Transwell® culture model with Caco-2 cells was used to test the applicability of the developed acidification protocol by performing an off-line measurement.

It combines the broadband excitation property of MLS-based impulse response (IR) measurements with the support vector machine (SVM) machine-learning (ML) model. This approach allows to speed up the measurements, thus reducing the energy-per-measurement parameter in order to make the system suitable for battery-powered portable devices.

Copper ions represent a cellular micronutrient that must be monitored for its potential hazardous effects. The application of electrochemical analysis for heavy metal ions detection and quantification in commercial cell culture media presents several issues due to electrolyte complexity and interferents. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of applications and OoC devices that implement the Anodic Stripping Voltammetry as an ion dosing technique due to the reasons reported above. In fact, considering just the peak intensity value from the measurement, it turns out to be challenging to quantify ion concentration since other ions or molecules in the media may interfere with the measurement. With the aim to overcome these issues, the present work aims to develop an automated system based on machine learning algorithms and demonstrate the possibility to build a reliable forecasting model for copper ion concentration on three different commercial cell culture media (MEM, DMEM, F12). Effectively, combining electrochemical measurements with a multivariate machine learning algorithm leads to a higher classification accuracy. Two different pH media conditions, i.e., physiological (pH 7.4) and acidic (pH 4), were considered to establish how the electrolyte influences the measurement. The experimental datasets were obtained using square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) and were used to carry out a machine learning trained model.

Sweat-based glucose sensing has emerged as a promising non-invasive alternative, but the significantly lower glucose concentrations (10–100 times lower than in blood) pose a challenge for sensor sensitivity and operation. Here, we present different measurement protocols for enzymatic electrochemical glucose sensors with enhanced sensitivity and sub-second response calibration algorithm. The resulting amperometric response accurately reflects glucose concentration, demonstrating the sensor's potential for non-invasive monitoring of glucose in sweat. To enhance the reliability of the measurements and mitigate the variability among sensors arising from differences in sweat composition and secretion, a post-measurement protocol was developed. This protocol exploits a Response Correction Factor (RCF) calculated from the specific sensitivity of each sensor. This approach compensates for variability among different sensors reducing the standard deviation, thereby improving calibration accuracy (R2 = 0.995 vs. R2 = 0.822 without correction) allowing the prevention of phenomena related to enzyme inactivation or allogeneic reactions that may affect individual sensors in Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) systems. An in-depth analysis was also conducted using sample microvolumes (20 μL), the typical amount of sweat available in wearable devices, to study thin-layer chronoamperometry response. To enhance the linearity of the sensor response, a differential compensation algorithm based on the slope of the response curve was adopted, employing a sensor without enzyme as a reference. This measurement method enhanced the dynamic range of slope values from 0.0085 μA/s to 0.0125 μA/s. The experimental results identified in a reliable way three operational regions: physiological (60–110 μM), warning values (110–160 μM) and alert/risk (>160 μM). The proposed strategies increase the robustness and applicability of sweat-based glucose monitoring for real-world applications.",Elisa Sciurti,SCRLSE91S67Z133L

The continuous monitoring of muscle electrical activity enables the detection of abnormal events, but existing sEMG systems often rely on disposable pre-gelled electrodes that can cause skin irritation and require precise placement by trained personnel. Wearable sEMG systems integrating textile electrodes have been proposed to improve usability; however, they often suffer from poor skin–electrode coupling, leading to higher impedance, motion artifacts, and reduced signal quality. To address these limitations, we propose a preliminary model of smart socks, integrating biocompatible hybrid polymer electrodes positioned over the target muscles. Compared with commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes, these hybrid electrodes ensure lower the skin–electrode impedance, enhancing signal acquisition (19.2 ± 3.1 kΩ vs. 27.8 ± 4.5 kΩ for Ag/AgCl electrodes). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first wearable system incorporating hydrogel-based electrodes in a sock specifically designed for the analysis of lower limb muscles, which are crucial for evaluating conditions such as sarcopenia, fall risk, and gait anomalies. The system incorporates a lightweight, wireless commercial module for data pre-processing and transmission. sEMG signals from the Gastrocnemius and Tibialis muscles were analyzed, demonstrating a strong correlation (R = 0.87) between signals acquired with the smart socks and those obtained using commercial Ag/AgCl electrodes.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the single-tracer technique for clinically node-positive (cN +) breast cancer patients who achieve node-negativity (ycN0) after NAC and compare this approach with the dual-tracer technique. We included consecutive patients diagnosed with cT1-T2, cN1-N2 breast cancer who underwent NAC and achieved nodal disease regression (ycN0). The patients were divided into two groups: “dual tracer” technique for sentinel lymph node identification and “single tracer” technique. In both groups, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was performed in patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes. Out of the 76 patients included, 42 underwent sentinel lymph node removal using the dual-tracer technique, while 34 underwent the single-tracer technique. In the single-tracer group, an average of two lymph nodes were removed per patient versus an average of three lymph nodes per patient in the dual-tracer group ( p = 0.001). No loco-regional recurrences have been reported in either group at a mean follow-up of 34 months. The single-tracer technique can be a reliable method for the axillary management in cN + breast cancer patients undergoing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and achieving nodal disease regression (ycN0), in terms of loco-regional recurrences. This demonstrates that even if fewer sentinel lymph nodes are identified using the single tracer technique (and potentially the false negative rate of the procedure is higher), this does not impact on the rate of loco-regional recurrences.

Oncoplastic breast surgery (OBS) has evolved from BCS to allow more extensive tissue removal while maintaining oncological safety and reducing the risk of post-surgical deformities. The ultrasound (US)-assisted periareolar approach in breast surgery offers several potential benefits, including reduced scarring, improved cosmetic outcomes, and enhanced surgical precision, particularly for non-palpable or small lesions, and potentially better nipple sensation preservation. This study aim to describe an US-assisted periareolar OBS approach for eBC patients with small to moderate breast ptosis. Methods Here we present a focus on surgical technique consisting in OBS combining a US-assisted periareolar approach with volume displacement in small- to moderate- ptosic breasts. Margin resection adequacy, surgical complications and patient satisfaction using the Breast-Q questionnaire were assessed. Results Thirty-two patients were considered. A negative margin of excision was achieved in all cases, and patients routinely received post-operative hypofractionated radiotherapy. Seroma was the most common complication (12.5%), while breast fat necrosis and minor wound infections occurred in 6% and 3% of cases, respectively. At a median follow-up of 12 months (range 6–18), post-treatment breast retraction occurred in 3 patients (9%), all of whom underwent fat grafting to improve outcomes. The average satisfaction score as determined by Breast-Q module was 78.6, rising to 81.3 for those who underwent contralateral mammaplasty. Discussion The combination of imaging, the use of oncoplastic surgical techniques and an appropriate post-operative management may provide the surgeon new tools for the treatment of eBC. In selected cases, the US-assisted periareolar oncoplastic approach is a versatile technique that can be easily adapted for tumors in any location of the breast.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q

In daily practice, the authors wrap the implant with a human-derived ADM (hADM) when they found mastectomy flaps thinner than 1 cm. When hADM is not available, an APM is used. Here, the authors present their results with APM utilisation. Methods: From January to September 2024, patients undergoing pre-pectoral breast reconstruction with mastectomy flaps thinner than 1 cm were selected. Specifically, implants were wrapped in bovine pericardium (Exaflex—MAGGI Srl, TO, Italy). During a minimum 6 months follow-up, outcomes were recorded; in particular, rippling incidence was assessed with indication for secondary fat grafting. Results: Nineteen patients met the inclusion criteria. Average age was 54.4 years (range: 39–70), three of them were smokers (15.8%) and three were affected from diabetes or hypertension (15.8%). With one case bilateral, a total of 20 mastectomies were performed. Intra-operative mastectomy flaps’ thickness mean measure was 0.75 cm (range: 0.5–0.8). All of them underwent two-stage pre-pectoral IBR with APM covering the implant. During a mean follow-up of 9.5 months (range: 6–13), no major post-operative complications occurred and five cases (25%) presented rippling. Conclusions: With no consensus on the superiority of either biologic matrixes or SMs, the authors extended their patients’ selection tool to aid in the choice of peri-prosthetic device. The bovine APM use showed capacity of reducing secondary lipofilling interventions in patients with thin mastectomy flaps.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q

Their treatment is not standardized due to limited outcome data and lack of management guidelines. We aimed to gather the first large multicentric cohort of cases and analyze oncological outcomes to identify the optimal therapeutic approach. Methods: This international multicentric study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT06133465) collected data from 23 centers. Patients diagnosed with pure PLCIS and/or FLCIS on core biopsy and/or final specimen pathology were included, with concurrent presence of classic (C-) LCIS permitted. Cases with associated (micro-) IC and/or DCIS were excluded. An internal slide review by a dedicated pathologist was required. A minimum follow-up of 2 years was guaranteed. Results: We collected 327 patients diagnosed with pure P-/FLCIS on core biopsy and/or on surgical specimen between 01/2004-06/2022. Of these, 58 showed P-/FLCIS only upon final histology, including 44/58 preoperative B3 lesions (17 CLCIS) and 14/58 misdiagnosed DCIS. The remaining 269 had a preoperative diagnosis of pure P-/FLCIS; of these, 82/269 cases (30.5%) upgraded on surgical specimen, with 72/82 (87.8%) to IC and 10/82 (12.2%) to DCIS (p&lt;0.001). The upgrade rate to IC was 32.4% for PLCIS and 14.9% for FLCIS (p=0.002). Factors significantly associated with upgrade included radiological mass-like aspect, size and multicentric distribution of the lesion, irregular margins on ultrasound, and presence of necrosis on core biopsy. Our analysis focused on the 245 (74.9%) cases diagnosed as pure PLCIS (152/245, 62%) or FLCIS (93/245, 38%) on surgical specimen. Median age was 58 years, and 79.2% of the patients were diagnosed through screening mammogram. MRI was performed in 46% of cases, with 68% showing a non-mass-like enhancement. Median lesion size was 13 mm (IQR 7.5-22). Mastectomy was performed in 22 cases, while 223/245 (91%) patients underwent lumpectomy. Margin involvement (defined as P-/FLCIS on ink) occurred in 52/223 cases (23.3%), leading to 21 re-excisions, 4 mastectomies, and no further intervention in 27 cases. Factors significantly associated with positive margins included pleomorphic form, calcifications and architectural distortion on mammogram, a radiological mass-like aspect, and multicentric distribution. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 62/245 (25.3%) cases, with no positive lymph nodes found. Adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to 38/245 (15.5%) patients, while 50/245 (20.4%) received adjuvant endocrine therapy. With a median follow-up of 76 months (IQR 34-91), local recurrence (LR) occurred in 35/245 (14.3%) cases, including 16 IC, 2 DCIS and 17 P-/FLCIS. Involved margin (p&lt;0.001) and multicentric radiological distribution (p=0.001) were associated with LR. Adjuvant therapies did not influence recurrence rates (RR) in patients with clear margins (p=0.3), nor in those with involved margins (p=0.06). Among patients with positive margins, local RR was significantly higher in patients who did not have a re-excision (22/27, 81.5%) compared to those who did (2/25, 8%) (p&lt;0.001). RR were similar between pure PLCIS and FLCIS cases (15.1% vs. 12.9%, p=0.427). The 5-year recurrence free survival was 84.6% for the entire cohort (95%CI 78.8-89%). Conclusion: In this cohort, yet the largest collected to date, the upgrade rate of pure P-/FLCIS to IC/DCIS was 30.5%, suggesting careful preoperative assessment. Axillary surgery should be omitted. Involved margins were associated with LR (invasive in nearly half of cases) while adjuvant therapies were not. Surgery with clear margins, and not adjuvant therapies, seem to be the mainstay of treatment for this disease.

The current literature was scrutinized to investigate the impact of dietary factors, such as the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet on reducing the risk of breast cancer. Additionally, the potential role of diet in diminishing the risk of disease recurrence and enhancing outcomes among breast cancer survivors was explored. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE to identify relevant studies published between 2000 and 2024. Inclusion criteria were applied to select studies with robust methodologies, including randomized clinical trials, meta-analyses, and prospective cohort studies focusing on adult women. Only studies published in English were considered. Papers on animal studies, editorials, and case series were excluded. Results: Our findings show the critical interplay between diet and breast cancer prevention, crucial for the development of effective strategies to both primary and tertiary prevention. Challenges such as adherence to dietary recommendations, cultural and socioeconomic disparities, and limited high-quality evidence were identified.

Breast related quality of life can be associated to breast anthropometry. This study was designed to explore this hypothesis, find relevant correlations and, using machine learning techniques, predict values of satisfaction with breast from easy body measurements. Methods Asymptomatic women undergoing routine clinical examination for breast cancer prevention were interviewed using the BREAST_Q V1 Breast Conserving Surgery Pre-op. Descriptive statistics was performed to describe the characteristics of the population. The Pearson correlation test defined correlation between relevant anthropometric variables and scores in each domain of the BREAST_Q. Regression analysis was employed to assess variation in the “Satisfaction with breast” domain when looking at the mirror dressed or undressed. Three machine learning algorithms were tested to predict scores in the “Satisfaction with breast domain” given body mass index and nipple to sternal notch distance. Results One-hundred and twenty-five women underwent clinical examination and assessment of anthropometry. The reply rate to the BREAST_Q ranged from 99.2 to 88% depending on the domains. The “satisfaction with breast” domain was negatively associated either to BMI [r Pearson = −0.28, CI (−0.41, −0.15) p Pearson = −0.15, CI (−0.29, −6.52e-03) p = 0.04]. The N_SN distance was also negatively associated to this domain with the following values for the right [r Pearson = −0.34, CI (−0.45, −0.21) p Pearson = −0.31, CI (−0.43, −0.17) p Conclusions This study generates normative scores for a Mediterranean population of asymptomatic women and demonstrates relevant associations between anthropometry and breast related quality of life. Machine learning techniques may predict scores of the “satisfaction with breast” domain of the Breast_Q using body mass index and nipple to sternal notch estimates as input. However, the algorithm seems to fail in approximately one third of the sample probably because is not able to capture many aspects of personal life. Much larger sample and more qualitative research is required before establishing any direct association between body estimates and quality of life.

However, challenges arise when performing NSM on patients with large and ptotic breasts because of the higher risk of nipple-areola complex (NAC) necrosis. This study proposes a new technique: the three pedicle–based nipple-sparing skin-reducing mastectomy (TP-NSSRM), combined with direct-to-implant (DTI) breast reconstruction, aimed at reducing complications. Methods: A prospective study was conducted from November of 2021 to April of 2022, enrolling patients with large and drooping breasts requiring mastectomy for breast cancer treatment or risk reduction. Patient selection criteria included a sternal notch–to-nipple distance of greater than or equal to 23 cm, grade 3 ptosis, and eligibility for immediate prepectoral DTI breast reconstruction. Patient satisfaction was assessed using BREAST-Q modules. Results: Seventy-two TP-NSSRM procedures combined with immediate DTI-based breast reconstruction were performed on a total of 45 patients. High patient satisfaction was observed, and statistically significant improvements were noted in postoperative BREAST-Q scores ( P = 0.001). The complication rate was low, and preservation of the nipple-areola complex was achieved in all cases. Conclusions: The TP-NSSRM technique offers a potential solution for patients with large and drooping breasts undergoing NSM. It aims to minimize complications and achieve satisfactory outcomes. This study demonstrates favorable results in terms of patient satisfaction and quality of life. Further research and long-term follow-up are necessary to validate these findings and evaluate the long-term outcomes of this technique.

Additionally, the best axillary surgical staging technique in this scenario is unknown. Objective To investigate oncological outcomes after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with dual-tracer mapping or targeted axillary dissection (TAD), which combines SLNB with localization and retrieval of the clipped lymph node. Design, Setting, and Participants In this multicenter retrospective cohort study that was conducted at 25 centers in 11 countries, 1144 patients with consecutive stage II to III biopsy-proven node-positive breast cancer were included between April 2013 and December 2020. The cumulative incidence rates of axillary, locoregional, and any invasive (locoregional or distant) recurrence were determined by competing risk analysis. Exposure Omission of ALND after SLNB or TAD. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary end points were the 3-year and 5-year rates of any axillary recurrence. Secondary end points included locoregional recurrence, any invasive (locoregional and distant) recurrence, and the number of lymph nodes removed. Results A total of 1144 patients (median [IQR] age, 50 [41-59] years; 78 [6.8%] Asian, 105 [9.2%] Black, 102 [8.9%] Hispanic, and 816 [71.0%] White individuals; 666 SLNB [58.2%] and 478 TAD [41.8%]) were included. A total of 1060 patients (93%) had N1 disease, 619 (54%) had ERBB2 (formerly HER2 )–positive illness, and 758 (66%) had a breast pathologic complete response. TAD patients were more likely to receive nodal radiation therapy (85% vs 78%; P = .01). The clipped node was successfully retrieved in 97% of TAD cases and 86% of SLNB cases (without localization). The mean (SD) number of sentinel lymph nodes retrieved was 3 (2) vs 4 (2) ( P &amp;lt; .001), and the mean (SD) number of total lymph nodes removed was 3.95 (1.97) vs 4.44 (2.04) ( P &amp;lt; .001) in the TAD and SLNB groups, respectively. The 5-year rates of any axillary, locoregional, and any invasive recurrence in the entire cohort were 1.0% (95% CI, 0.49%-2.0%), 2.7% (95% CI, 1.6%-4.1%), and 10% (95% CI, 8.3%-13%), respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of axillary recurrence did not differ between TAD and SLNB (0.5% vs 0.8%; P = .55). Conclusions and Relevance The results of this cohort study showed that axillary recurrence was rare in this setting and was not significantly lower after TAD vs SLNB. These results support omission of ALND in this population.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q

The likelihood of finding additional positive lymph nodes in patients with residual isolated tumor cells (ITCs) is unknown, and the benefit of ALND is unclear. As a consequence, surgical management of the axilla in these patients is not standardized. We sought to evaluate how often additional positive lymph nodes are found, to determine factors associated with ALND, and to compare oncological outcomes in patients treated with and without ALND after identification of residual ITCs in the SLN. Methods: Data were collected from 42 centers: 20 in the Oncoplastic Breast Consortium (OPBC) and EUBREAST networks, and 22 in North and South America. We included patients with cT1-4 N0-3 breast cancer at diagnosis who underwent NAC followed by axillary staging with either SLN biopsy (SLNB) or targeted axillary dissection (TAD) and were found to have residual ITCs [ypN0(i+)]. Single-tracer mapping was allowed for cN0 patients, while dual mapping or TAD was required for cN+ cases. Axillary treatment included completion ALND and/or nodal radiotherapy (RT). Competing risk analysis was performed to assess the cumulative incidence rates of any axillary recurrence (AR), locoregional recurrence (LRR), and any invasive (locoregional or distant) recurrence. Five-year cumulative incidence rates were compared between patients who underwent ALND and those who did not using the Gray’s test. Type I error rate was set to 0.05 (α). Results: We included 412 patients treated with NAC followed by surgery from 01/2009-05/2022. 146 (35.4%) had completion ALND and 266 (64.6%%) did not. Median patient age was 48 years. The majority (57%) of patients had clinical T2 tumors, and 68% had biopsy-proven N1 disease. Most were HR+/HER2- (41%) or HER2+ (39%). Most patients (80%) received anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. Nodal RT was administered to 83% of patients. The median number of SLNs with ITCs was 1. Patients treated with ALND were more likely to have ITCs detected on frozen section (61% v 6.7%, p&lt; 0.001), to have N2/3 disease at presentation (15.1% v 5.6%, p=0.001) and to have LVI (40% v 26%, p=0.004) (Table 1). There was no significant trend over time in the proportion of patients undergoing completion ALND during the study period (p=0.5). In the ALND group, additional positive nodes were found in 43/146 (29.5%) of cases, and consisted of macrometastases in 11/146 (7.5%), micrometastases in 9/146 (6.2%), and ITCs in 23/146 (15.8%). 5-year rates of any AR, LRR, and any invasive recurrence in the entire cohort were 2.7% (95% CI 1.2-5.4), 2.8% (95% CI 1.2-5.4) and 16% (95% CI 11-21), respectively. There was no statistical difference between patients who underwent ALND and those who did not in any of the 3 endpoints (2.2% v 3.1%, p=0.6), (2.6% v 3.0%, p=0.4) and (14% v 18%, p=0.12), respectively. Conclusion: The likelihood of finding additional positive lymph nodes in patients with ITCs after NAC is lower than in patients with residual micro- and macrometastases, and in the majority of cases, they contain ITCs. Nodal recurrence after omission of ALND is rare in this population. Overall, these results do not support routine ALND in patients with residual ITCs. Table 1.

Since 2006, following a resolution issued by the European Parliament to urge member states to activate multidisciplinary breast centers by 2016, work has been underway throughout Italy to improve the management of women with BC. In Italy, the State-Regions agreement was signed on 18 December 2014, sanctioning the establishment of breast units. These centers must adhere to specific quality criteria and requirements. In 2020, the experts of the EUSOMA group (European Society of Breast Cancer Specialists), in their latest document published, expanded the requirements of the breast units. Furthermore, Senonetwork was founded in 2012 with the aim of allowing BC to be treated in breast units that comply with European requirements to ensure equal treatment opportunities for all Italian women. Indeed, the available data indicate that the BC patient has a greater chance of better treatment in the breast units with a multidisciplinary team, thus increasing the survival rate with a better quality of life, compared to those managed in nonspecialized structures.

The perception of society toward social exposure of the breast has been extremely diverse, not only temporally through the same civilization but also among contemporary parallel societies in geographically diverse areas. This article explores the spatial and temporal evolution of the outlook toward social exposure of breast over the past 3000 years among different societies, countries, and religions. The level of “acceptance” or “tolerance” toward visibility of breast in social situations was historically guided by social conditioning. Recently, the personal attitudes and preferences of the women themselves have become more deterministic of the clothing choices. Consequently, the conventional oncoplastic notion of a “no-scar zone” being the upper-inner quadrant of the breast must also be redefined to match the dynamic personal preferences of the patient. It is important to know what the patient thinks is the “most social” area of the breast for her, and then to avoid scars in those areas if possible. The article discusses the quest to minimize scars and the importance of shared decision making.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q

Objective To assess expert panel and computerized evaluation modalities against patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), the gold standard of AO assessment, in patients after surgical management of BC. Data Sources Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov were interrogated from inception through August 5, 2022. Search terms included breast conserving AND aesthetic outcome AND breast cancer . Ten observational studies were eligible for inclusion, with the earliest date of database collection on December 15, 2022. Study Selection Studies with at least 1 pairwise comparison (PROM vs expert panel or PROM vs computerized evaluation with Breast Cancer Conservation Treatment cosmetic results [BCCT.core] software) were considered eligible if they included patients who received BC treatment with curative intent. Studies reporting solely on risk reduction or benign surgical procedures were excluded to ensure transitivity. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted study data with an independent cross-check from a third reviewer. The quality of included observational studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the level of evidence quality was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Confidence in network meta-analysis results was analyzed with the Confidence in Network Meta-analysis semiautomated tool. Effect size was reported using random-effects odds ratios (ORs) and cumulative ratios of ORs with 95% credibility intervals (CrIs). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome of this network meta-analysis was modality (expert panel or computer software) discordance from PROMs. Four-point Likert responses across PROMs, expert panel assessment, and BCCT.core evaluation of AOs were assessed. Results A total of 10 observational studies including 3083 patients (median [IQR] age, 59 [50-60] years; median [range] follow-up, 39.0 [22.5-80.5] months) with reported AOs were assessed and homogenized in 4 distinct Likert response groups ( excellent , very good , satisfactory , and bad ).

Overall, panel and software modalities graded AO outcomes worse than PROMs. Specifically, for excellent vs all other responses, the panel to PROM ratio of ORs was 0.30 (95% CrI, 0.17-0.53; I 2 = 86%) and the BCCT.core to PROM ratio of ORs was 0.28 (95% CrI, 0.13-0.59; I 2 = 95%), while the BCCT.core to panel ratio of ORs was 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.46-1.88; I 2 = 88%). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, patients scored AOs higher than both expert panels and computer software. Standardization and supplementation of expert panel and software AO tools with racially, ethnically, and culturally inclusive PROMs is needed to improve clinical evaluation of the journey of patients with BC and to prioritize components of therapeutic outcomes.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q

Several retrospective cohort studies and single surgeon series reported benefits with the use of ADMs. However, robust evidence supporting these advantages is lacking. There is the need to define the role for ADMs in implant-based breast reconstruction (IBBR) after mastectomy. Methods: A panel of world-renowned breast specialists was convened to evaluate evidence, express personal viewpoints, and establish recommendation for the use of ADMs for subpectoral one-/two-stage IBBR (compared with no ADM use) for adult women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer treatment or risk reduction using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Based on the voting outcome, the following recommendation emerged as a consensus statement: the panel members suggest subpectoral one- or two-stage IBBR either with ADMs or without ADMs for adult women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer treatment or risk reduction (with very low certainty of evidence). Conclusions: The systematic review has revealed a very low certainty of evidence for most of the important outcomes in ADM-assisted IBBR and the absence of standard tools for evaluating clinical outcomes. Forty-five percent of panel members expressed a conditional recommendation either in favor of or against the use of ADMs in subpectoral one- or two-stages IBBR for adult women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer treatment or risk reduction. Future subgroup analyses could help identify relevant clinical and pathological factors to select patients for whom one technique could be preferable to another.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q

However, breast cancer treatment has undergone changes, and the results of recent population-based registry studies suggest superior long-term survival after BCS. To explore the current evidence, a systematic review and meta-ana lysis of population-based observational studies from 2010 and onward was conducted. Methods: A literature search was conducted in the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases to identify relevant literature. Keywords included “mastectomy,” “breast conserving surgery,” and “survival.” The identified studies were narratively reviewed and effect sizes (hazard ratios [HRs]) for overall (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were combined with random-effects models. Results: A total of 30 reports were included in the review, and results from 25 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Compared with mastectomy, BCS was associated with better OS (HR = 1.34 [1.20–1.51]; N = 1,311,600) and BCSS (HR = 1.38 [1.29–1.47]; N = 494,267). Selected subgroups of patients, based on lymph node status, age ( Conclusions: The combined findings from large population-based studies indicate that BCS is associated with survival benefit compared with mastectomy, suggesting that BCS be the recommended treatment of early breast cancer (T1-2N0-1M0) if a radical lumpectomy can be performed.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q
