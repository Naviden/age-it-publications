Yet, the complexity of these models often obscures their inner workings, posing significant challenges in scenarios requiring transparency and explainability. This survey conducts a comprehensive review of eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) strategies focused on enhancing the interpretability of word embeddings. By classifying the existing body of work into six broad categories based on their methodological approaches—a classification that, to our knowledge, does not exist in the literature—we provide a structured overview of current techniques and their characteristics. Additionally, we uncover a noteworthy oversight: a predominant emphasis on interpreting model outputs at the expense of exploring the models’ internal mechanics. This finding underscores the necessity of shifting research efforts toward not only clarifying the results these models produce but also demystifying the models themselves. Such a shift is crucial for uncovering and addressing biases inherent in word embeddings, thus ensuring the development of fair and trustworthy AI systems. Through this analysis, we identify key research questions for future studies and advocate for a holistic approach to transparency in word embeddings, encouraging the research community to explore both the outcomes and the underlying algorithms of these models.",Navid Nobani,NBNNVD87P21Z224J,200,

Numerous studies have explored various aspects of life and overall quality of life for both patients and their families. Our research specifically focuses on the caregiver burden scale and was conducted at the Down Syndrome Outpatient Clinic at the Policlinic Hospital of Federico II, which operates every Thursday. The study utilized a questionnaire consisting of 10 questions, with a total of 100 patients participating. These questions aimed to evaluate different dimensions of caregivers’ lives, including social, economic, and psychological factors. The scoring system is based on the Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSCF), which ranges from 0 (minimal burden) to 3 (maximum burden). Our findings reveal that certain aspects of caregiving are more significantly affected than others. For example, the median score for physical health is 105, indicating that this area is the most impacted by Down syndrome. In contrast, the median score for psychological health stands at 68.2, suggesting it is the least affected area.",ANTONIO PICONE,PCNNTN84M09F839T,200,

This is important to accommodate the prevailing situation where the interest rate and mortality intensity move jointly and randomly. A stochastic correlation model is considered where it follows a diffusion process that may assume the form of a bounded Jacobi process or of a transformed modified Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. Our contributions strengthen the general modelling set up of dependent financial and actuarial risks. We put forward a discrete-time pricing model that supports the valuation of a relatively wide class of insurance products. Specifically, the pricing of contracts, with an embedded surrender option for which no explicit formulae are available, is facilitated with ease. We customise the construction of lattice discretisations that admit a large set of risk processes having appropriate specifications. In particular, the interest rate, mortality and correlation dynamics are discretised via three different binomial lattices that are then assembled to create a trivariate lattice structured with eight branches for each node. Numerical experiments involving some stylised insurance contracts are conducted. Such experiments confirm the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed approach with respect to two benchmarks: the Monte-Carlo simulation method, and the method and results by Devolder et al. (2024).",Emilio  Russo,RSSMLE79H20D086B,200,

Unfortunately, the lack of effective molecular tools for the manipulation of these environmental strains still hampers our understanding of their peculiar strategies to thrive in freezing conditions, limiting the functional genomics approaches to differential analyses only. Over the past two decades, our research group established the first effective gene cloning/expression technology in the Antarctic Gram-negative marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis TAC125. The setup of a genome mutagenesis technique (based on homologous recombination and counterselection events) further supported the use of this strain, which became an attractive model for studying microbial adaptations to freezing lifestyle. Moreover, to further extend the functional analyses to its essential genes, the set-up of a conditional gene silencing approach is desirable. In this paper, we report the development of an asRNA regulatory system in the Antarctic bacterium, testing the feasibility of Hfq-dependent and PTasRNA strategies previously developed in Escherichia coli.

However, biomedical and technological advancements have now reached a stage where it appears increasingly possible to repair the damage caused by severe pathologies and reverse the functional decline that accompanies aging. This perspective highlights the significance of using aging models, specifically non-transgenic geriatric mice (aged over 24 months), to study interventions aimed at reversing or ameliorating age-related pathologies. While most research typically utilizes young, adult, and mid-aged mice to investigate aging mechanisms and develop preventive strategies, geriatric models provide unique insights into the efficacy and safety of treatments in conditions that mimic the complexities of multiple concurrent diseases or syndromes. This manuscript highlights the importance of considering timing responses in aging interventions, illustrated by recent findings such as those involving canagliflozin. These studies reveal that the timing of intervention can significantly influence the outcomes, highlighting aspects often overlooked. Practical challenges and resource demands associated with geriatric mouse studies including concerns related to animal husbandry and aging phenotypes are also discussed. This perspective aims to foster a deeper understanding of the potential benefits and limitations of geriatric mice models in geroscience research and emphasizes the need for continued innovation in this field to meet the critical need to develop effective treatments for age-related diseases.",Marco Malavolta,MLVMRC71H26A271V,200,

Overall, we find that: (i) a higher SVO score goes with higher contributions; (ii) higher beliefs go with higher contributions; (iii) dCC does not appreciably account for contributions; (iv) conditional contributions elicited with the strategy method predict actual contribution for the stated belief; (v) while (i)–(iv) are unaffected by treatments, contributions under motivated delay are about 10% higher than under time pressure. Our experimental evidence suggests that altruism, beliefs and predicted contributions account for contributions regardless of the extent of deliberation, which however seems to impact positively and independently contributions.",Tatiana  Celadin,CLDTTN93D47F382Q,200,

The impact of cellular senescence on frailty varies depending on the assessment tool used, as it is influenced by the criteria or items predominantly affected by senescent cells and the varying weights assigned to these items across different health domains. To address this challenge, we undertook a thorough review of all available studies involving gain- or loss-of-function experiments as well as interventions targeting senescent cells, focusing our attention on those studies that examined outcomes based on the individual frailty phenotype criteria or specific items used to calculate two humans (35 and 70 items) and one mouse (31 items) frailty indexes. Based on the calculation of a simple “evidence score,” we found that the burden of senescent cells related to musculoskeletal and cerebral health has the strongest causal link to frailty. We deem that insight into these mechanisms may not only contribute to clarifying the role of cellular senescence in frailty but could additionally provide multiple therapeutic opportunities to help the future development of a desirable personalized therapy in these extremely heterogeneous patients.",Marco Malavolta,MLVMRC71H26A271V,200,

After some preliminary clarifications–concerning the meaning of social justice, the concept of generation, and the specificity of age–the issue of what is the analytical unit of justice between coexisting generations is discussed: is it age-group or is it birth cohort? And the perspective is the consideration of age groups at a specific point of time, or is the whole lives of individuals, rendering justice between cohorts? When at issue there is relational equality, age-groups are shown to be the appropriate units; when at issue there is political equality, the generational imbalance between citizens may be faced either way, depending on the underlying conception of democracy. When we deal with distributional fairness, the whole life view would be preferable, but also encounters a few obstacles. The whole life view provides the background to evaluate simultaneous distributions between age groups. It is argued that the distributive principle that best translates the desiderata of integrating the age group comparison with the whole life perspective is an age-specific principle of sufficiency. The Introduction then proceeds to place in context and illustrate the different articles of the collection.",Anna Galeotti,GLTNLS53C69A794C,200,

And more specifically, how can such sacrifices be justified when those we act for are neither born nor easily unidentifiable? While many accounts of moral motivation exist, most scholars will grant that emotional engagement is a strong motivational drive. Hence, the paper will focus on such a drive. I will, first, argue that immediate emotions and empathy – understood uniquely as a form of emotional attunement – are insufficient to grant that the acts they motivate are morally acceptable. The case of future generations is a perfect example of such insufficiency. Second, I will discuss the possibility of regulated emotions and sympathy playing such a role. In fact, by regulating and educating emotions, a conscious or “rational” component is added, which could help avoid the biases and limitations immediate affective phenomena show. Such a “rational” component would also enable us to provide a criterion to distinguish cases in which emotions drive us in morally acceptable or unacceptable directions. In the second part of the paper, the sentimentalist tradition will be reconsidered, with particular attention to Adam Smith’s moral proposal – since the sympathetic engagement of an impartial spectator could be an excellent example of a regulated and educated emotional attunement of the kind required to deal with some of the many moral issues future generations raise and, in particular, with the motivational problem itself.",Sarah Songhorian,SNGSRH87A47F205O,200,

To bridge this gap, we conducted an EEG-based study examining the relationship between mental fatigue dynamics and personality traits-specifically extroversion (comparing extroverts and introverts) and neuroticism (contrasting high vs. low levels)-to enable personalized fatigue profiling. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study to establish such connections within this framework. Twenty-one participants completed cognitively demanding tasks (mental arithmetic and simulated job interviews) while EEG data were recorded using a wearable system. Subjective fatigue, measured post-task using the Chalder Fatigue Scale (CFS), revealed significant differences (p<0.05$) between personality groups. Objective biomarkers were derived via spectral power analysis of EEG data from key frontal, temporal, central, and posterior regions. Two-tailed ttests indicated that extroverts exhibited lower frontal fatigue, while temporal regions showed delta and theta differences for neuroticism and beta differences for extroversion. Central regions displayed spectral differences in all bands except delta and beta for extroversion, with the left central region showing significant differences across all bands for neuroticism. At the posterior region, fatigue variations were observed in all bands at the left posterior except theta band in extroversion and beta for neuroticism. Spatial brain maps further confirmed significantly lower fatigue in extroverts and low-neuroticism individuals, aligning with the subjective reports.",Raffaele Gravina,GRVRFL82E07D086B,200,

Traditionally, emotional content with low dynamic range has been employed for anxiety assessment, with personality traits serving as mediators. This paper introduces a novel approach, examining the influence of personality traits on the relationship between anxiety and electroencephalography (EEG) frontal Theta-Beta Ratio (TBR) during high dynamic range (HDR) arousal-valence affective content exposures. Twenty-seven subjects were categorized into five groups based on big five personality scores, further subdivided into high and low personality traits. Correlation analyses were conducted separately for the right and left frontal regions. Across four HDR video clips, each positioned within a distinct valence-arousal plane, it was observed that for High Arousal High Valence (HAHV) and High Arousal Low Valence (HALV), most personality trait groups exhibited a negative correlation between anxiety and frontal TBR, while a positive correlation was noted for Low Arousal Low Valence (LALV) and Low Arousal High Valence (LAHV) HDR emotional content.

To better bridge the gap between structure and function, it is crucial to identify the factors shaping this regionality, not only in terms of how static functional connectivity aligns with structure, but also regarding the time-domain variability of this interplay. Here we map structure - function coupling and its time-domain variability and relate them to the heterogeneity of the cortex. We show that these two properties split the cortical landscape into two districts anchored to the opposite ends of the brain's hierarchy. By looking at statistical relationships with layer-specific gene transcription, T1w/T2 w ratio, and synaptic density, we show that macro-scale structure-function coupling may be rooted in the brain's microstructure and meso‑scale laminar specialization. Finally, we demonstrate that a lower and more variable alignment of function and structure may bestow the emergence of unique functional dynamics.",Alessandra Del Felice,DLFLSN78P64Z133P,200,

Some evidence suggests a possible link between FOXP2 genetic variability and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) pathology and related endophenotypes. To shed light on this issue, we analysed the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FOXP2 and FTD in 113 patients and 223 healthy controls. In addition, we investigated SNPs in two putative targets of FOXP2, CNTNAP2, Contactin-associated protein-like 2 and PRNP, prion protein genes. Overall, 27 SNPs were selected by a tagging approach. FOXP2-rs17213159-C/T resulted associated with disease risk (OR = 2.16, P = 0.0004), as well as with age at onset and severity of dementia. Other FOXP2 markers were associated with semantic and phonological fluency scores, cognitive levels (MMSE) and neuropsychological tests.

Although oral health may influence these domains, it remains underexplored within the IC model. The present study was the first to comprehensively examine the associations among self-reported oral health and IC domains. Methods: We analyzed data from 845 adults aged ≥ 60 years from the 2009–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), representing approximately 9.10 million non-institutionalized U.S. individuals aged ≥ 60 years. Self-reported oral health indicators included symptoms, treatment history, and hygiene behaviors. IC domains were approximated using conceptually aligned variables available in NHANES. Results: Perceived gum disease and reported bone loss were inversely associated with unintentional weight loss (vitality) [odds ratio (OR) = 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI):0.30–0.96 and OR = 0.56; 95%CI:0.35–0.90, respectively].

Reporting teeth becoming loose without injury, visible tooth abnormalities, and regular flossing were associated with cognitive impairment, but not in fully-adjusted models. No significant associations were observed for mouthwash use or having ever received treatment for gum disease. Conclusion: Self-reported oral health indicators were associated with several IC domains in older adults.

From the 30,468 NHANES subjects, we included participants aged ≥ 60 years with available PD and IC data. IC was assessed across five domains: locomotion, cognition, psychological well-being (depressive symptoms/anhedonia), sensory function (vision/hearing), and vitality (nutrition/weight loss). PD was classified as moderate or severe using CDC/AAP criteria. After applying exclusion criteria, 551 participants were included in the analyses.

Nevertheless, MFCAs very often have no training in elder care and even less in the dementia care. Conversely, elder care training may improve MFCAs’ working condition and mental health. Exploring MFCAs’ educational needs is one of the objectives of the “Age-It” project, aiming at advancing knowledge and competences on ageing by applying a holistic, interdisciplinary, and problem-solving approach through the synergic work of research and educational institutions, care providers and civil society associations, businesses and industries. Methods: In Autumn 2023, 25 semi-structured questionnaires, including both closed and open-ended questions, were conducted with MFCAs living in two Italian regions: Marche and Molise. The research material was thematically analysed to answer four research questions: Which is the work experience of MFCAs of older adults with long-term care needs? Which are their educational needs? Which are the barriers to training? Did the emigration geographical area of respondents and the migration route influence their willingness to attend an elder care training? Results: Three main themes were identified: (1) Migration: a painful choice to flee poor (violent) societies; (2) Elder care: a stressful work; (3) Needs and barriers to elder care education. Most interviewed MFCAs face many difficulties at work, including stress, burden and lack of free time. Many respondents expressed the need and willingness to improve their knowledge on ageing processes, dementia, behavioural disorders, medicine administration, bedsores and injuries medication. The 24 h work represents the main barriers to attend the lessons. Discussion: Suggestions for future trainings include a co-designed curriculum embedding contents on dementia and behavioural disorders; self-care and resilience; host country language. Concerning policy and practice recommendations, mandatory, free and periodic, blended trainings, a clear offer of elder care education, the recognition of previous courses at EU and national level are encouraged. Conclusions: Given the pivotal role of MFCAs in the LTC in Italy, it is urgent that they are adequately trained. Given the stressful and 24 h work, a co-designed e-learning platform may be a promising means for reaching and training them.

Audio recordings were used for acoustic analysis, and a custom pre-trained sentiment classifier was implemented to perform sentiment scoring on preprocessed and tokenised transcriptions. Statistical analysis highlighted a significant increase in sentiment, indicating the beneficial effects of medical intervention on quality of life and significant improvements in vocal quality in male patients, i.e., more stable and less noisy voices. Moreover, female patients presented a significant positive correlation between fundamental frequency and sentiment, underlying that restoring a more feminine voice helped achieve a more positive mood.Clinical Relevance-The proposed tool provides an additional point of view to evaluate more quickly and automatically the psychophysiological impact of medical intervention. Moreover, it is also independent of gender, voice pathology, and treatment type, fostering its potential widespread use and applicability.",Pietro Tarchi,TRCPTR93H07D612I,200,

Among these, Electrodermal Activity (EDA) remained relatively underexplored. This study investigates the potential of EDA as a tool for distinguishing emotional states based on the arousal domain of affect in dyads. Twenty-two healthy participants (11 dyads) observed the same affective images in pairs. Four active sessions, composed of 20 images selected from the IAPS database, were presented with progressively increasing arousal levels. This study hypothesized that the physical presence of another subject during the affective stimulation affected the subject's perception and influenced their emotional response. Both intra-subject and inter-subject analyses revealed distinct patterns in EDA dynamics with increasing arousal, highlighting significant inter-individual variability in responses to identical stimuli. These findings underline EDA's potential as a psychophysiological marker for studying emotional states and provide a promising relevant contribution to hyperscanning studies, especially in exploring emotional synchrony and regulation within dyads during affective tasks.Clinical RelevanceThis study highlights the potential of EDA-based measures to support hyperscanning research, raising several questions about their role in exploring emotional synchrony and regulation within dyads during visually affective tasks.

METHODS: An interdisciplinary focus group formulated the BMS Blueprint Persona by discussing clinical data and survey results regarding education, informatics skills, and perceived unmet needs, collected from 500 BMS patients between 2022 and 2023. RESULTS: The BMS Blueprint Persona, named Anna, represents a typical BMS patient profile: a young-old woman with limited computer skills who experiences anxiety, depression, and insomnia, has memory issues leading to medication adherence challenges, is obese due to overeating, and spends much time watching TV at home. Anna's primary concern is receiving inadequate treatment and not achieving disease remission. She also feels misunderstood and lacks family support. This persona reveals several areas where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) interventions, like telemedicine, anxiety and insomnia treatment, drug adherence improvement, and nutritional and lifestyle guidance, could be beneficial.

The early diagnosis of cervical anomalies in hospitals in three countries (Italy, Ethiopia, and Albania) was the main focus of this study, which investigated FL to evaluate colposcopy data. A ResNet50-based deep learning model was developed for feature extraction and classification using a data set of 385 colposcopy images annotated by five expert gynecologists in each region using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT). In addition, the UNET deep learning technique was used to segment the regions of cervical cancer. To preserve patient privacy and ensure data sovereignty, the proposed approach utilizes federated learning to train the ResNet50 model collaboratively across multiple edge devices, using Flower 4.1 and Stratus Cloud tools for simulation. The proposed approach achieved a classification accuracy of 68.72% with a loss of 2.199% in a holdout test set, demonstrating slightly good generalization across devices with minimal performance degradation during federated aggregation. This study underscores the potential of advanced AI-driven methodologies in resource-constrained healthcare settings. In addition, the proposed approach minimizes the need for centralized data storage while protecting patient privacy using FL. The foundation for expanding this approach to larger datasets and a wider range of healthcare applications is laid by these encouraging outcomes, which will eventually increase access to trustworthy diagnostics in environments with limited resources.",Sileshi Nibret Zeleke,ZLKSSH94B12Z315U,200,

This renders it a valuable laboratory for investigating medium and long-term trends concerning age-friendly policies, not only within the European context. From a demographic perspective, Italy is grappling with two intertwined crises: the depopulation of historical regions and the ageing of the population. These issues pose a substantial challenge to the sustainability of the welfare system and social cohesion. Italy is among the first countries in the world in terms of the percentage of elderly people out of the total population. It is therefore of utmost importance that national and local policies in favour of the elderly population be based on empirical data to promote age-friendly cities and communities, able to face the challenge posed by the sudden demographic change taking place in our country. To address these cognitive needs, the article presents a preliminary set of recommendations derived from the analysis of the AFCCQ-IT dataset. This analysis is based on a survey conducted on a representative sample of the elderly population residing in three Italian cities, within the framework of the Age-It programme. The results of the study demonstrate significant discrepancies in terms of demographic characteristics, including gender, age and socio-economic status, as well as perceived quality of territorial social and health services and architectural barriers.

We demonstrate that micro-heterogeneity of the membrane protein CRIPTO in mouse-activated SCs (ASCs) identifies metastable cell states that allow a rapid response of the population to environmental changes. Mechanistically, CRIPTO micro-heterogeneity is generated and maintained through a process of intracellular trafficking coupled with active shedding of CRIPTO from the plasma membrane. Irreversible perturbation of CRIPTO micro-heterogeneity affects the balance of proliferation, self-renewal, and myogenic commitment in ASCs, resulting in increased self-renewal in vivo. Our findings demonstrate that CRIPTO micro-heterogeneity regulates the adaptative response of ASCs to microenvironmental changes, providing insights into the role of intrinsic heterogeneity in preserving stem cell population diversity during tissue repair.",Gabriella  Minchiotti,MNCGRL65A66F839V,200,

This study investigates the integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with FL to enhance predictive healthcare applications. KAN's innovative implementation of spline-based activation functions offers enhanced flexibility, interoperability, and efficiency in capturing complex nonlinear data patterns with fewer parameters than traditional neural networks. When benchmarked against standard Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), KANs show significant performance improvements in both real-world and synthetic electrocardiogram (ECG) datasets. Notably, KAN's adaptive activation functions, particularly quadratic splines with a grid size of 30, effectively capture the complexities of time-series data, achieving a test accuracy of 93.73% and an F1-score of 92.90% on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. Furthermore, KAN outperformed MLP on synthetic ECG data, highlighting its potential for broader medical applications. Despite its higher computational overhead, federated KAN shows considerable promise in healthcare settings that require both privacy and high accuracy in modeling complex data patterns. The findings underscore the need for optimization to address computational inefficiencies in KAN-based FL environments while establishing a foundation for future applications of KAN in time-series-based medical diagnostics.",Sileshi Nibret Zeleke,ZLKSSH94B12Z315U,200,

Federated learning (FL) emerges as an attractive solution to allow decentralized nodes to collectively train shared machine learning models without the need of transmitting sensitive data to a central database. This can safeguard privacy while effectively leveraging the distributed computational resources available in the cloud-edge continuum. In health informatics, the need for robust privacy-preserving mechanisms is paramount, especially when the nodes of the FL system are associated with datasets from individual patients, as opposed to the case of databases that include many patients (such as those available from hospitals). This need becomes particularly significant when addressing diagnoses and predictive analytics in personalized medicine, precision medicine, risk stratification, and longitudinal monitoring. We explore the applications of FL frameworks in the context of cloud-edge in healthcare. We identify real-world settings to assess the benefits and challenges of personalized federated learning. These include data imbalance issues, usability, promoting replicability, improving security, minimizing environmental impact (greenness), and optimizing overall efficiency.",Sileshi Nibret Zeleke,ZLKSSH94B12Z315U,200,

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of loneliness among hospitalized older patients, and its association with baseline characteristics and clinical post-discharge outcomes. Design: Multicenter observational study, including a cross-sectional and a longitudinal phase. Setting: Acute medical hospital wards of three Italian hospitals. Partecipants: Three hundred patients ≥65 years old. Measurements: A questionnaire was administered to participants, including socio-demographic data, and information on loneliness (assessed with 3-item UCLA scale and 6-item De Jong Gierveld and Van Tilburg Loneliness scale-DJGT), cognitive, emotional and functional level. Rehospitalizations and mortality were evaluated 1 and 6 months after discharge. Results: A high prevalence of loneliness emerged with both scales (63% with UCLA, 60% with DJGT). At multiple linear regression analyses, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was independently associated with UCLA (B coeff. 0.46, p < 0.001) and DJGT (B coeff. 0.51, p < 0.001) scales, and Basic Activities of Daily Living with UCLA scale (B coeff. −0.21, p = 0.02). In longitudinal analysis, global loneliness scores were not associated with mortality and rehospitalization risk, while the item n.6 of DJGT scale (“There are enough people I feel close to”) was independently associated with higher mortality risk within 1 and 6 months from discharge (OR 4.6, 95%C.I. 1.64–12.92; OR 4.38, 95%C.I. 1.83–10.48, respectively). Conclusion: Loneliness was reported by more than half of older adults hospitalized in acute medical wards, and was associated with depressive symptoms and disability. The perception of scarce social ties was associated with higher mortality risk. Awareness of the “loneliness” phenomenon should be increased also in clinical settings.",Giuseppina Dell'Aquila,DLLGPP77S56C726I,200,

In contrast, prostate cancer is the most prevalent cancer in men and serves as a model for understanding male-specific tumor biology. The advent of high-throughput technologies has enabled the development of gene expression signatures for both breast and prostate tumors that could inform prognosis and guide treatment. In this respect, the role of the tumor microenvironment, particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), remains largely underexplored. Here, we sought to identify a CAF-related gene signature in male patients with BC and prostate cancer to reveal specific protumorigenic mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets for both malignancies. Methods: RNA sequencing was performed to analyze and compare the transcriptomes of CAFs isolated from female and male BC patients. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between female and male breast CAFs were identified and subjected to enrichment analyses. Using a set of candidate upregulated genes in male breast CAFs, K-means clustering of prostate cancer patients was performed using multiple datasets to define a prognostic gene signature. Kaplan‒Meier curves and log-rank tests were conducted to assess differences in patient outcomes and other clinical variables between groups of patients with high or low prognostic gene expression. The clustering results were then validated using decision tree analysis, and boosted calculations were employed to increase the classifier performance. Results: Transcriptomic profiling revealed 775 DEGs between female and male breast CAFs. Owing to the limited transcriptomic data from male BC patients, we leveraged large prostate cancer cohorts to investigate the relevance of the genes expressed by male breast CAFs. A six-gene signature (ASPN, COL4A1, COL4A2, COL5A3, COMP and FN1) that could predict patient outcomes in multiple independent cohorts of prostate cancer patients was identified. Conclusions: We identified a novel gene signature with strong prognostic value in prostate cancer and potential relevance to male BC. This gene signature represents a complementary tool to standard clinical parameters for improving patient stratification and management.",Rosamaria  Lappano,LPPRMR82T62D086R,200,

However, a clear relationship between delirium onset and diabetes mellitus has not been clarified. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between DM and delirium with the following aims: (a) to assess the incidence of delirium among DM patients (b) to assess the risk of delirium onset in patients with DM (c) to assess the role of anti-diabetic drugs on delirium onset. Methods: MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched from inception up to 30th of December 2024. Studies reporting the incidence of delirium in diabetic patients, delirium events in diabetic patients compared to non- diabetic patients, and the role of antidiabetic drugs on delirium development were considered. Results: The pooled incidence of delirium resulted 29% (95% CI 26.0%- 33.0% I2 = 99.6%). The OR for developing delirium resulted: 1.78 (95% CI 1.59–1.99 i2 = 88.3%) Intranasal insulin administration compared to placebo groups was characterized by a RR = 0.34 (95% CI 0.23–0.52). Metformin use compared to non-metformin use in diabetic patients was characterized by lower RR for delirium: pooled RR = 0.71 (95% CI 0.59–0.85, I2 = 84.8%). Conclusions: The incidence of delirium in patients with diabetes is about 29% and patients with diabetes have higher odds of delirium. Chronic use of metformin, and intranasal insulin administration before surgery may offer benefits in the prevention of delirium. These findings are characterized by significant heterogeneity which hampers their interpretation. Future research for developing diabetes-specific delirium screening protocols, and evidence-based preventive interventions is needed.",Giusepppe  Rengo,RNGGPP78S30F839T,200,

In mammalian cells, it is organized as a ribbon-like structure that can undergo dynamic reorganizations, which are crucial for various cellular processes, including mitosis and cell migration. During mitosis, the Golgi complex is subjected to a tightly regulated disassembly process, essential for proper cell division, while its reformation is critical for inheritance by daughter cells. Disruption of Golgi organization has been linked to pathological conditions, including cancer, as altered organization and function can contribute to tumor progression by impacting glycosylation, cell polarity, and extracellular matrix remodeling. This chapter explores the molecular mechanisms regulating Golgi disassembly during the cell cycle and its involvement in ensuring proper cell division. Additionally, we discuss the emerging understanding of the potential role of modifications of the Golgi organization in tumor development and metastasis. Collectively, the findings presented in this chapter underscore the physiological significance of the Golgi ribbon structure and the pathological implications of its alterations in cancer progression, which could offer novel therapeutic opportunities for cancer treatment.",Antonino Colanzi,CLNNNN64B29E435X,200,

In this context, driving simulators can play a significant role in upper limbs rehabilitation, permitting bidirectional interaction between the system and the participant and an extensive data collection to support patient performance evaluation while allowing the gradual reintegration of one of the most relevant daily activities. This work presents an initial setup of a post-stroke rehabilitation driving simulator and focuses on estimating the electro-mechanical model parameters representing the physical device, exploiting both encoder and voltage sensor information installed in the setup.

In particular, accurate estimates of muscle activities and forces that a patient can exert during the movement is of paramount importance to quantify, analyze and monitor the progress of the adopted rehabilitation therapy. Digital twins of musculoskeletal systems provide meaningful and prompt analysis integrating anatomy and physiology characteristics of human beings. Among the numerical techniques, multibody models are largely used in the bio-mechanical community enabling a wide range of studies. Nonetheless, system inputs and operating conditions are often unknown or might differ from reality. State observers, such as Kalman filter techniques, are successfully used in mechanical applications to overcome these limitations linking digital twins and real measurements. In the following contribution, an in-house virtual sensing platform is presented where the multibody model of an upper limb articulation is exploited in a Kalman filter-based scheme to indirectly and jointly estimate muscle forces and marker trajectories during a virtual rehabilitation exercise by means of the well-known OpenSim platform chosen as ground-truth. The contribution presents the virtual sensing framework, the upper limb model description and the estimation results, analyzing the effectiveness and limitations of the proposed approach.",Domenico  Mundo,MNDDNC75P06L049K,200,

This work proposes the adoption of a socially assistive robot in Intensive Care Units to evaluate the criticality scores of bedridden patients. Within this scenario, the human gaze represents a key clinical cue for assessing a patient’s conscious state. In this work, a user study involving 10 participants role-playing 4 levels of consciousness is performed. The collected videos were manually annotated considering 6 gazing directions and an open-source automatic tool was used to extract head pose and eye gazing features. Different feature sets and classification models were compared to find the most appropriate configuration to detect user gaze in this scenario. Results have suggested that the most accurate gazing estimation is obtained when the head pose information is combined with the eye orientation (0.85). Additionally, the framework proposed in this study seems to be user-independent, thereby encouraging the deployment of appropriate robotic solutions in real assistive contexts.",Alessandra Sorrentino,SRRLSN93B50H501T,200,

Their roles in energy balance, inflammation, and muscle metabolism suggest potential for predicting geriatric syndromes, yet prospective evidence is limited. Methods: Plasma GDF15 and FGF21 and multidimensional geriatric assessment at baseline and at 6-year follow-up in 52 community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years from the FRASNET cohort. Results: Over a six-year follow-up, participants exhibited signs of functional decline, including increased waist circumference, greater fatigue severity, and higher medication use. FGF21 levels declined significantly over time (p = 0.03), whereas GDF15 levels remained stable. Higher baseline GDF15 levels identified individuals at higher risk to become frail (AUC= 0.85 with Fried Phenotype and AUC= 0.96 with Clinical Frailty Scale) or malnourished (AUC=0.94) and at risk to fall (AUC=0.98). FGF21 associated to malnutrition (AUC=0.98). GDF15 prospectively associated to high risk of frailty and negatively associated with physical performance and nutritional status after six years. Conclusions: In this cohort, higher baseline levels of GDF15 and FGF21 were associated with the risk to become frail or malnourished. These findings support the integration of mitokines into early risk stratification tools for older adults. Further validation in larger cohorts is warranted.",Sarah Damanti,DMNSRH84E58A662Y,200,

However, the specific contribution of kidney function to frailty remains underexplored. This study aims to assess the impact of kidney function on frailty in a large population of older adults. Methods: The FRASNET cohort, including elderly, non hospitalized individuals, was evaluated for frailty, markers of kidney, glomerular, and tubular function, and for anthropometric parameters. Results: We included 1183 individuals in this study (59.9% females, age 65–93). Among them, 27.7% of subjects were classified as robust, 37.6% were pre-frail, and 34.7% were frail. The prevalence of frailty increased with age (43% in individuals over 76 years of age) and was associated with obesity (28.3%) and polytherapy (23.2%). Whole estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 73.8 (IQR 62.4, 84.7) ml/min/1.73 m2. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased across frailty classes from 15.2% in robust to 29.0% in frail individuals (P < 0.001). Among young-old subjects (65–75 years old), comorbidity was the main determinant of frailty, whereas in older subjects, when eGFR was below 53.5 ml/min/1.73 m2, it was associated with frailty (P < 0.002). Fractional excretion of sodium progressively increased across frailty classes, from 0.71% in robust individuals (IQR 0.46–1.03) to 0.79% in frail subjects (IQR 0.48–1.17) (P = 0.04). Conclusion: This study revealed a strong relationship between CKD and frailty, identifying a new eGFR threshold associated with frailty in older adults. The alterations in age- and frailty-dependent sodium handling highlight the potential role of the often-overlooked tubular function in older individuals.",Sarah Damanti,DMNSRH84E58A662Y,200,

Design: Longitudinal study. Setting and participants: We included 863 community-dwelling participants ≥65 years from the Chianti region in Italy. Mesurements: Habitual dietary intake of dairy products (i.e., milk, yogurt, and cheese) was assessed in daily servings using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 9-years of follow-up. Frailty status at each visit was defined using the Fried criteria, and the probability of transitions between different frailty status and death was assessed through multistate models. The associations between dairy product intakes and frailty transitions during the 9-year period were expressed as hazard ratios (HRs) derived from proportional intensity models. Results: The mean age at baseline was 74 ± 7 years and 46% of the participants were male. There were no statistically significant associations between the consumption of total, fermented, or non-fermented dairy products and the probabilities of transition from robust or from pre-frail to any of the other frailty conditions or to death. Conversely, a direct association between the consumption of fermented dairy products and the probability of transition from frail to pre-frail was observed in a model adjusted for age, sex, and energy intake (HRper serving/day = 1.90, 95%CI 1.12−3.22). This association was primarily related to yogurt consumption (HRper serving/day = 4.07, 95%CI 1.38−12.02), as the association with cheese consumption was not significant (HRper serving/day = 1.57, 95%CI 0.91−2.71). In the fully adjusted model, only the association between yogurt consumption and frail to pre-frail transition remained statistically significant (HRper serving/day = 3.68, 95%CI 1.10−12.31). Conclusion: Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese, are unlikely to play a predominant role in frailty development in an Italian community-dwelling older population. However, it is advisable to maintain a moderate consumption of dairy products, especially fermented ones, as part of a well-balanced diet to promote healthy aging.",Antonio   Cherubini,CHRNTN66L09I921H,200,

In this study, we investigate whether this extends to housing tenure trajectories. Methods: Using 2017 SHARELIFE retrospective data, we explore how housing tenure trajectories (ages 16–65) are associated with multiple health outcomes among 65–75 years-old adults residing in eleven European countries. We use sequence and cluster analysis to identify main types of housing tenure trajectories and logistic regression models to explore their association with outcomes of self-rated health, chronic morbidity, and activity limitations (GALI). Results: We identified six clusters of housing tenure trajectories: ‘early-homeowners’ (62.6 %), ‘late-homeowners’ (7.1 %), ‘never-leavers’ (11.6 %), ‘private tenants’ (9.3 %), ‘social tenants’ (6.4 %), and ‘rent-free and others’ (3.1 %). Non-standard housing tenure trajectories patterns – particularly those of ‘social tenants’, ‘private tenants’, and ‘never-leavers’ – were associated with poorer later-life health compared to the standard pattern of ‘early-homeowners’, consistently across outcomes and more evidently among women. We found weaker evidence for variation of the association across country groups, with some exceptions. Conclusion: Housing tenure trajectories across the life course are associated with later-life health outcomes. In particular, non-standard housing tenure trajectories are associated with a health disadvantage in later life compared to the standard pattern of early-homeowners, characterised by an early transition and a long-term stay in homeownership.",ELEONORA TRAPPOLINI,TRPLNR89L67C773O,200,

Vaccinations effectively reduce the risk of severe clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, but their impact on platelet activation and immunothrombosis during breakthrough infections is not known. Objectives: To investigate how preemptive vaccinations modify the platelet-immune crosstalk during COVID-19 infections. Methods: Cross-sectional flow cytometry study of the phenotype and interactions of platelets circulating in vaccinated (n = 21) and unvaccinated patients with COVID-19, either admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU, n = 36) or not (non-ICU, n = 38), in comparison to matched SARS-CoV-2–negative patients (n = 48), was performed. Results: In the circulation of unvaccinated non-ICU patients with COVID-19, we detected hyperactive and hyperresponsive platelets and platelet aggregates with adaptive and innate immune cells. In unvaccinated ICU patients with COVID-19, most of whom had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, platelets had high P-selectin and phosphatidylserine exposure but low capacity to activate integrin αIIbβ3, dysfunctional mitochondria, and reduced surface glycoproteins. In addition, in the circulation of ICU patients, we detected microthrombi and platelet aggregates with innate, but not with adaptive, immune cells. In vaccinated patients with COVID-19, who had no acute respiratory distress syndrome, platelets had surface receptor levels comparable to those in controls and did not form microthrombi or platelet–granulocyte aggregates but aggregated avidly with adaptive immune cells. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that vaccinated patients with COVID-19 are not associated with platelet hyperactivation and are characterized by platelet–leukocyte aggregates that foster immune protection but not excessive immunothrombosis. These findings advocate for the importance of vaccination in preventing severe COVID-19.",Stefania Basili,BSLSFN61A57H501V,200,

However, its subjective nature can introduce measurement errors, leading to biased estimates of health determinants. This study addresses the issue of misclassification in SRH assessments among the older adult population in Italy, using data from the 2019 European Health Interview Survey. We consider an extension of the ordered probit model that accounts for misclassification. A Monte Carlo simulation study shows a net improvement in parameter estimates, which may result in highly biased estimates when misclassification of the dependent variable is ignored. The real data analysis reveals that while the direction of estimated effects is consistent with traditional models, parameter estimates are more accurate and the effect sizes are significantly larger when misclassification is accounted for. In line with previous studies, the results indicate that age, marital status, education, and employment status are significant predictors of SRH, with geographical disparities also playing a role. Additionally, we identify sex-specific patterns in SRH reporting, with women more likely than men to misclassify their health status. The proposed model not only enhances the accuracy of SRH evaluations but also provides valuable insights for policymakers to better target health interventions, ensuring more efficient resource allocation and improved health outcomes. This study highlights the need to refine analytical models to address the complexities of subjective health assessments and suggests potential applications of this approach to other self-assessed health indicators.",ELEONORA TRAPPOLINI,TRPLNR89L67C773O,200,

In this study, we investigated educational disparities in the risk of dementia diagnosis in administrative health records (dementia incidence) and subsequent healthcare utilization among dementia patients. We analysed the Lazio Region Longitudinal Study (Italy) from 2012 to 2022. We applied Cox regression to investigate disparities in dementia incidence and three subsequent healthcare utilization outcomes (all-cause hospitalizations, potentially preventable hospitalizations, and emergency visits). In a cohort of dementia-free 50–90-year-olds (907 453 men and 1 083 538 women), we found strong and age-patterned disparities in dementia incidence. Compared to highly-educated, the incidence in low-educated men and women was higher, especially at ages 50–64 (HR = 2.09, 95 % CI: 1.69–2.58 and HR = 2.17; 95 % CI: 1.71–2.74). In the follow-up of 27 158 men and 40 797 women incident dementia cases, low-educated had higher risk of all-cause hospitalizations (HR = 1.24; 95 % CI: 1.16–1.32 and HR = 1.18; 95 % CI: 1.09–1.27), potentially-preventable hospitalizations (HR = 1.27; 95 % CI: 1.17–1.37 and HR = 1.19; 95 % CI: 1.08–1.31) and emergency visits (HR = 1.33; 95 % CI: 1.26–1.41 and HR = 1.27; 95 % CI: 1.18–1.35). Disparities in hospitalization are reduced after adjusting for health conditions pre-existing dementia identification, less so those in emergency visits.

Traditional disease-centered endpoints may be inadequate for this population, presenting unique challenges related to frailty, functional decline and disability. Objectives To systematically review the literature on outcomes considered relevant in interventions targeting older adults with multimorbidity, based on both patient and healthcare professionals’ perspectives. Methods This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023478249). We searched five electronic databases for primary quantitative and qualitative studies including patients aged ≥ 60 years with ≥ 2 chronic conditions. Outcomes were categorized into six domains: 1) Physical conditions/outcomes; 2) Mental conditions/outcomes; 3) Psychosocial outcomes/general health; 4) Healthcare utilization and costs; 5) Patients’ behaviors; 6) Care process outcomes. We conducted a narrative synthesis and compared outcomes across qualitative and quantitative studies. Results Seventy-one studies were included (53 quantitative, 16 qualitative, 2 mixed-methods). The most frequently reported outcomes fell under Psychosocial outcomes / General health (69.0 %), followed by Care process outcomes (52.1 %) and Healthcare utilization and costs (49.3 %). Qualitative studies more often addressed Mental health outcomes (43.8 %). Maintaining independence, physical function, and quality of life emerged as most important outcomes for older adults. Conclusions In intervention studies involving older adults with multimorbidity, outcomes should move beyond disease-specific measures to include independence, physical function and quality of life. Outcome selection should account for patient clinical heterogeneity, frailty, and life expectancy to ensure relevance and impact in this complex population.",Barbara  Carrieri,CRRBBR88T44A271K,200,

In the context of an increasing need for home adaptation in response to the needs of the elderly and caregivers, this paper introduces a novel design support system, merging Virtual Reality (VR) and semantic technologies to facilitate the reconfiguration of bedrooms, integrating Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions. The methodology combines a knowledge representation of user health conditions, physical environments, and device characteristics with a virtual simulation for pre-implementation evaluation. The system leverages domain ontologies to provide semantic and computational representations of the space and its features; the semantic knowledge base is engineered referencing building (IFC) and healthcare standards (ICF, ICD) alongside ontologies for devices and assistive technologies. The middleware is implemented to connect, translate, and exchange data between the ontologies and the VR-simulated environment. The system, exploiting semantic reasoning, can guide the designers in choosing the best options, including assistive technologies, spatial re-organization, and indoor comfort metrics. The reconfigured bedroom models can then be exported to any design software via IFC-BIM data exchange. Initial implementations demonstrate the system’s efficacy in customizing spaces for two user profiles with chronic conditions, proposing a comprehensive BIM-based tool for spatial and assistive technology integration in home spaces for enhanced elderly quality of life.",Tiziana Ferrante,FRRTZN65R52D643E,200,

An early diagnosis of AD remains important as interventions are plausibly more effective when started at the earliest stages. Recent developments in clinical research have focused on the use of blood-based biomarkers for improve diagnosis/prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly AD. Unlike invasive cerebrospinal fluid tests, circulating biomarkers are less invasive and will become increasingly cheaper and simple to use in larger number of patients with mild symptoms or at risk of dementia. In addition to AD-specific markers, there is growing interest in biomarkers of inflammaging/neuro-inflammaging, an age-related chronic low-grade inflammatory condition increasingly recognized as one of the main risk factor for almost all age-related diseases, including AD. Several inflammatory markers have been associated with cognitive performance and AD development and progression. The presence of senescent cells, a key driver of inflammaging, has also been linked to AD pathogenesis, and senolytic therapy is emerging as a potential treatment strategy. Here, we describe blood-based biomarkers clinically relevant for AD diagnosis/prognosis and biomarkers of inflammaging associated with AD.

However, metabolic dysregulations in cachexia are currently studied in an organ-specific manner, failing to be fully integrated into a comprehensive framework that explains their functional roles in disease progression. Thus, in this review, we aim to provide a general overview of the various metabolic alterations with a potential systemic impact.",Elia Angelino,NGLLEI89C07B041K,200,

In the past, many commercial wearable sensors have been used to detect falls, with limitations in terms of cost and usability. Consequently, there is still a growing interest in the scientific community studying issues related to active and healthy aging. The integration of fall detection functionality into commercial smartwatches represents a solution of clear advantage. It is generally related to the application of threshold values to the accelerometer signals acquired by the wearable device but with important limitations in terms of accuracy. More recently, Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques were widely investigated, but again, adequate classification results were not obtained mainly due to the lack of specific fall datasets and the imbalance within them of events to be classified. The proposed work describes the design and implementation of a fall detection system based on a smartwatch and a smartphone. Firstly, we developed an application that collects the raw acceleration sensor data acquired from the smartwatch and sends them to the smartphone through a Bluetooth connection. Then, we apply a Transfer Learning approach to scalogram images generated, using the Continuous Wavelet Transform, from the raw accelerometric signals. In this way, we try to overcome the small dataset training problem for fall detection, especially for elderly subjects. Preliminary results obtained on a benchmark dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline using DenseNet201 deep architecture for Transfer Learning, reaching an accuracy of about 97.6%.",Andrea MANNI,MNNNDR75L21B936A,200,

One of the prominent application areas is the development of ‘smart’ environments, primarily in private spaces such as ‘smart’ homes. However, implementing these technologies in shared spaces could also offer significant benefits, particularly in clinical waiting rooms, which stand out as a neglected research area despite their potential to improve patient experience and healthcare outcomes. These spaces pose several challenges, including an increased stress level and a lower perceived care quality, as they naturally accommodate many individuals who spend extended periods of time there. Also, the environmental characteristics of waiting rooms that affect occupants’ stress or emotions are yet to be fully investigated. To address these challenges, this work aims to design a Virtual Reality (VR)-based prototypical waiting room that aims to support the evaluation of customized environmental features impact on the waiting experience. This allows for a straightforward assessment of their effects on patients’ perceived stress and well-being, even in the absence of a real physical environment.

The memories are exploited by six games designed and implemented in a Pepper robot considering current practices. We report on a mixed-method study consisting of a two-phase trial that involved 15 MCI older adults. The participants first furnished some memories from their past, and then used two game versions regularly for twelve weeks, one personalised and one with general content.

We find evidence of a large and persistent effect of hospitalization on total health care expenditures, with future medical expenses mostly accounted for by inpatient care. Considering all health treatments, the overall effect is sizable and is about twice the cost of a single hospital admission. We show that chronically ill and disabled individuals require greater post-discharge medical assistance, especially for inpatient care, and that cardiovascular and oncological diseases together account for more than half of expenditures on future hospitalizations.

The study aims to address the difficulty that conventional ASR systems face in capturing the temporal irregularities of disfluent reading, which are crucial for psycholinguistic and clinical analyses of fluency. Building upon the WhisperX framework, the proposed system replaces the neural Voice Activity Detection module with an energy-based segmentation algorithm designed to preserve prosodic cues such as pauses and hesitations. A dual-alignment strategy integrates two complementary phoneme-level ASR models to correct onset–offset asymmetries, while a bias-compensation post-processing step mitigates systematic timing errors. Evaluation on the READLET (child read speech) and CLIPS (adult read speech) corpora shows consistent improvements over baseline systems, confirming enhanced robustness in boundary detection and transcription under disfluent conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides a general, language-independent framework for accurate alignment and disfluency-aware ASR. The approach can support downstream analyses of reading fluency and speech planning, contributing to both computational linguistics and clinical speech research.",Vito  Pirrelli,PRRVTI61S01A662V,200,

However, the lack of a standardised framework and inconsistent interpretations of key constructs hinder meaningful comparison across studies and contexts. This article presents a systematically derived framework and structured dataset that capture the constructs, measurement approaches and methodological advancements involved in operationalising healthy ageing. The framework and dataset originate from the systematic review conducted by Piriu et al. (2025), which comprehensively maps the range of concepts, constructs and operational dimensions – measures, metrics, instruments and scales – used in 55 empirical studies that operationalise healthy ageing, each addressing at least two of the three core domains identified by the World Health Organization: intrinsic capacity (IC), functional ability (FA) and the environment (ENV). The Piriu et al. (2025) framework (hereafter PIETHA) introduces a multilayered categorisation of the healthy ageing construct, articulating it into three domains (IC, FA, ENV), 15 sub-domains, and 84 themes. This structure reflects both conceptual and measurement considerations (e.g. subjective vs. objective categories, self-reported vs. assessed/tested) while also providing a novel, detailed organisation of the environmental factors shaping healthy ageing at different levels of analysis (micro, meso and macro). Reflecting this multidimensional structure, the dataset complements the framework by documenting the specific tools employed in healthy ageing operationalisation, including assessment scales, validated instruments and measurement methodologies. By systematically analysing how healthy ageing is operationalised across disciplines, the PIETHA framework and related dataset support the identification of conceptual, empirical and methodological gaps in healthy ageing research. This enables researchers to generate new hypotheses, explore underrepresented areas – such as environmental and psychosocial dimensions – and advance integrative metrics. The framework and dataset also enhance methodological transparency and data reuse due to a structured design anchored in thematic identification, construct classification and comprehensive mapping of measurement practices. This facilitates replication, comparison and innovation in the field by enabling the systematic evaluation of interconnected factors and measurement strategies across studies and contexts. The framework and dataset offer a foundational resource to support the harmonisation of healthy ageing metrics and research strategies. They allow researchers and practitioners to: (i) obtain a structured overview of the concepts, constructs and measurement approaches used in healthy ageing research; (ii) assess the strengths and limitations of existing frameworks and methods, and compare approaches across domains and contexts to ensure we measure what matters; and (iii) address persistent gaps and develop the operational evidence base, especially concerning the contextual factors that enable healthy ageing and longevity. Ultimately, the dataset supports the continued development of robust, context-sensitive knowledge and methods for monitoring healthy ageing globally.",Aleksandra Torbica,TRBLSN75R42Z118V,200,

Methods: Retrospective cohort drawn from healthcare administrative records of all inhabitants within Romagna's catchment area, Italy, with an estimated onset of type 2 diabetes in 2008–2017 and aged ≥ 55, with follow-up until 2020. Time to dementia or censoring was estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method, using diabetes onset as the time origin. Age groups were compared with the log-rank test. Multivariable competing-risks analysis was used to assess predictors of dementia. Results: In patients aged ≥ 75 years, dementia-free survival (DFS) declined to below 90 % within five years and linearly decreased to 68.8 % until the end of follow-up. In contrast, DFS for those aged 55–64 years showed a marginal decrease, reaching 97.4 % after 13 years. Competing-risks regression showed that individuals aged ≥ 75 and 65–74 had a significantly higher risk of dementia compared to those aged 55–64 years. Having more comorbidities at diabetes onset and initial treatment with ≥ 2 antidiabetics were clinical predictors. Conclusions: Later age at onset of diabetes is strongly associated with dementia.

Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study including 11,441 incident cases of diabetes in 2015–2017, with follow-up until 2022. A multi-state survival analysis was performed on a seven-state model with 15 transitions to capture disease progression and onset of mental disorders. Results: Eight-year probabilities of depression, dementia, diabetes-related complications, and death were 9.7% (95% CI 8.7–10.7), 0.9% (95% CI 0.5–1.3), 10.4% (95% CI 9.5–11.4), and 14.8% (95% CI 13.9–15.7), respectively.

In particular, 3D bioprinting makes it possible to develop constructs with an organized distribution of cells. Over the years, a wide variety of materials has been used to create environments that emulate the extracellular matrix. Among these, gelatin methacrylate (GelMA)-based bioinks have widely been studied for extrusion-type 3D bioprinting. Several investigations have shown that GelMA at low concentrations (≤5% w/v) can promote cell viability, although limiting 3D printability, owing to poor retention of shape after extrusion. In this work, a new bioink formulation was developed to improve printability, while maintaining a high cell viability. For this purpose, xanthan gum (XG) was added to GelMA. The composite hydrogel had an elastic modulus of ~9 kPa, comparable to typical values of cardiac tissue. 3D printing tests (without cells) showed the printability of the new hydrogel. Both 2D and 3D cellular adhesion and viability tests showed the hydrogel ability to preserve survival and growth of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs).",Federico Carpi,CRPFRC75B10G702O,200,

They exclude the sense of touch, despite its fundamental role in cognitive processes. To overcome this limitation, we are developing a compact, easy-to-use and low-cost haptic technology and a new strategy for VR-based cognitive rehabilitation at home in front of a computer screen. The new technology engages, for the first time, also the sense of touch. It consists of novel wearable tactile displays of softness that can generate tactile feedback on the user’s fingertips, while performing visuo-tactile tasks in VR. The system enables tactile interactions with virtual soft objects, whose properties can be controlled and tailored to the user. The integration of tactile perception and vision produces unprecedented immersive cognitive experiences, more natural. As a long-term expectation, this new approach might enable rehabilitation strategies never attempted before, not only more engaging (to increase therapeutic adherence), but also possibly more effective. Indeed, they might improve cognition, learning and brain reserve, owing to the stimulation of cognitive areas and functions affected by aging, like executive/attention function and tactile memory. This paper describes ongoing preliminary psychophysical tests, aimed at assessing the perceptual performance of this novel technology in healthy subjects.",Federico Carpi,CRPFRC75B10G702O,200,

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to skeletal muscle wasting in cancer cachexia, yet the upstream molecular drivers remain elusive. Here we show that cancer impairs the activity of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and of its transcriptional effector CREB1 in skeletal muscle, ultimately contributing to the downregulation of a core transcriptional network that supports mitochondrial integrity and function. The restoration of cAMP–PKA–CREB1 signalling through pharmacological inhibition of the cAMP-hydrolysing phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) rescues the expression of mitochondrial-related genes, improves mitochondrial function and mitigates skeletal muscle wasting in male mice. Altogether, our data identify tumour-induced suppression of the cAMP–PKA–CREB1 axis as a central mechanism contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle during cancer cachexia. Furthermore, these findings highlight PDE4, particularly the PDE4D isoform, as a potential therapeutic target to preserve muscle mitochondrial function and counteract muscle wasting in cancer cachexia.",Andrea Graziani,GRZNDR58C11E625X,200,

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-Smad1/5/8 signaling alterations are emerging drivers of muscle catabolism, hence, characterizing these perturbations is pivotal to develop therapeutic approaches. We identified two promoters of “BMP resistance” in cancer cachexia, specifically the BMP scavenger erythroferrone (ERFE) and the intracellular inhibitor FKBP12. ERFE is upregulated in cachectic cancer patients' muscle biopsies and in murine cachexia models, where its expression is driven by STAT3. Moreover, the knock down of Erfe or Fkbp12 reduces muscle wasting in cachectic mice. To bypass the BMP resistance mediated by ERFE and release the brake on the signaling, we targeted FKBP12 with low-dose FK506. FK506 restores BMP-Smad1/5/8 signaling, rescuing myotube atrophy by inducing protein synthesis. In cachectic tumor-bearing mice, FK506 prevents muscle and body weight loss and protects from neuromuscular junction alteration, suggesting therapeutic potential for targeting the ERFE-FKBP12 axis.",Andrea Graziani,GRZNDR58C11E625X,200,

A number of molecular pathomechanisms and hallmarks of aging have been recognized, yet we miss a thorough understanding of their complex interconnectedness. This review explores the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human aging, with a focus on the multiple roles of high mobility group Box 1 protein (HMGB1), the archetypal damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule. In the nucleus, this non-histone chromatin-associated protein functions as a DNA chaperone and regulator of gene transcription, influencing DNA structure and gene expression. Moreover, this versatile protein can translocate to the cytoplasm to orchestrate other processes, such as autophagy, or be unconventionally secreted into the extracellular environment, where it acts as a DAMP, combining inflammatory and regenerative properties. Notably, lower expression of HMGB1 within the cell and its heightened extracellular release have been associated with diverse age-associated traits, making it a suitable candidate as a universal biomarker of aging. In this review, we outline the evidence implicating HMGB1 in aging, also in light of an evolutionary perspective on its functional pleiotropy, and propose critical issues that need to be addressed to gauge the value of HMGB1 as a potential biomarker across age-related diseases and therapeutic target to promote healthy longevity.",Erika Di Domenico,DDMRKE97P46I348J,200,

Therefore, investigating this pathophysiological phenomenon is crucial for understanding cardiovascular aging and enhancing both health span and lifespan. In the present study, we examined samples of subjects enrolled within the angiographically controlled Verona Heart Study (VHS), which provides a robust model for cardiovascular aging, particularly regarding coronary artery disease (CAD). We analyzed 44 older subjects diagnosed with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 42 healthy, sex- and age-matched controls (CAD-FREE). Employing deep sequencing and an amplicon-based approach, we focused on 11 key genetic regions in ASXL1, DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, PPM1D, SF3B1, SRSF2, TET2, TP53, and U2AF1 genes to investigate clonal hematopoiesis. Subjects in the CAD group exhibited a significantly higher variant burden than those in the CAD-FREE group, both in terms of the total number of somatic variants and disruptive variants affecting protein function. This increased mutational load was notably influenced by six specific genetic regions: ASXL1, DNMT3A, IDH2, JAK2, TET2, and U2AF1, which displayed elevated variant rates in the CAD subjects. Moreover, ASXL1, DNMT3A, IDH2, JAK2, SF3B1, TET2, and TP53 exhibited substantially higher levels of disruptive variants in the CAD group. In summary, our findings highlight a correlation between clonal hematopoiesis and the accumulation of disruptive variants in specific genomic regions in the VHS cohort, thereby shedding light on their potential role in cardiovascular aging.",Cristina Giuliani,GLNCST86C58C573G,200,

A possible detrimental role for this protein is then hypothesized to emerge with age.

They are commonly found in a variety of signaling proteins and are important for mediating protein-protein interactions in numerous cellular processes. PTB domains can also exhibit binding to unphosphorylated ligands, suggesting that they have additional binding specificities beyond phosphotyrosine recognition. Structural studies have reported that the PTB domain from FRS2 possesses this peculiar feature, allowing it to interact with both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated ligands, such as TrkB and FGFR1, through different topologies and orientations. In an effort to elucidate the dynamic and functional properties of these protein-protein interactions, we provide a complete characterization of the folding mechanism of the PTB domain of FRS2 and the binding process to peptides mimicking specific regions of TrkB and FGFR1. By analyzing the equilibrium and kinetics of PTB folding, we propose a mechanism implying the presence of an intermediate along the folding pathway. Kinetic binding experiments performed at different ionic strengths highlighted the electrostatic nature of the interaction with both peptides. The specific role of single amino acids in early and late events of binding was pinpointed by site-directed mutagenesis. These results are discussed in light of previous experimental works on these protein systems.",Stefano Gianni,GNNSFN76A27H501Z,200,

These interactions have been quantified and structurally characterized in numerous studies such that we today have a comprehensive picture of protein structure and function. However, proteins are dynamic and even folded proteins are likely more heterogeneous than they appear in most descriptions. One property of proteins that relies on dynamics and heterogeneity is allostery, the ability of a protein to change structure and function upon ligand binding to an allosteric site. Over the last decades the concept of allostery was broadened to embrace all types of long-range interactions across a protein including purely entropic changes without a conformational change in single protein domains. But with this re-definition came a problem: How do we measure allostery? In this opinion, we discuss some caveats arising from the quantitative description of single-domain allostery from an experimental perspective and how the limitations cannot be separated from the definition of allostery per se. Furthermore, we attempt to tie together allostery with the concept of frustration in an effort to investigate the links between these two complex, and yet general, properties of proteins. We arrive at the conclusion that the sensitivity to perturbation of allosteric networks in single protein domains is too large for the networks to be of significant biological relevance.",Stefano Gianni,GNNSFN76A27H501Z,200,

Recognizing the significant burden of diabetes as a leading cause of disability and mortality, the Emilia-Romagna Region of Italy introduced clinical guidelines for diabetes management in 2010 to enhance the quality of care for patients with type 2 diabetes. This initiative enables GPs working within Community Health Homes to collaborate with Nursing Outpatient Clinics (NOCs) for more effective chronic disease management. This study evaluates the impact of NOCs on key indicators of patient adherence with clinical guidelines. Using a balanced panel of administrative, individual-level data, we analyse the diabetic population over 65 years old within the largest Local Health Authority in Emilia-Romagna over a seven-year period (2010–2016). To assess the impact of NOCs on patient adherence, we employ alternative difference-in-differences approaches while accounting for heterogeneous treatment effects due to varying patient exposure periods. Our findings indicate that patients enrolled with GPs who integrate NOCs into diabetes management exhibit significantly improved adherence to clinical guidelines.

Recanalization therapies, including thrombolysis and thrombectomy, are essential for restoring blood flow and saving ischemic tissue. However, these interventions may trigger reperfusion injury, worsening inflammation and tissue damage, leading to blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebral edema (CE) and adverse functional outcomes. Here we propose a model integrating circulating inflammatory biomarkers with metabolomic and lipoproteomic data able to help clinicians in predicting BBB disruption, CE at 24 h post stroke onset and poor post-stroke functional outcome (Modified Rankin Scale (mRS > 2). Methods: Peripheral blood from 87 patients was collected at admission and 24 h after stroke onset. The logistic LASSO regression algorithm was employed to identify the optimal combination of metabolites, lipoprotein-related parameters and circulating biomarkers to discriminate the groups of interest at the two time-points. Results: Multivariable logistic regression models included as covariates: age, sex, onset-to-treatment time, treatment with lipid-lowering medications before stroke, history of heart failure, history of atrial fibrillation and history of diabetes. The regression models showed that methionine, acetate, GlyA and MMP-2 were significant predictors of BBB disruption, methionine, acetate, TIMP-1 and CXCL-10 predicted 24-hours CE, whereas a poor functional outcome at three months was predicted by CXCL-10, IL-12 and LDL-5. Conclusions: As stroke has a heterogeneous pathophysiology, a personalized approach based on biomarkers, as presented in this study, shown to be effective in tackling patient individual risk and could help in developing novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic neuroprotective strategies for the management of stroke patients.",Alessia Vignoli,VGNLSS88M42D612Z,200,

The great variability in disease evolution and the incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying AD make it difficult to predict when a patient will convert from prodromal stage to dementia. We hypothesize that metabolic alterations present at the level of the brain could be reflected at a systemic level in blood serum of patients, and that these alterations could be used as prognostic biomarkers. Methods: This pilot study proposes a serum investigation via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in a consecutive series of AD patients including 57 patients affected by Alzheimer’s disease at dementia stage (AD-dem) and 45 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD (MCI-AD). As control group, we considered 31 subjects with mild cognitive impairment in whom AD and other neurodegenerative disorders were excluded (MCI). A panel of 26 metabolites and 112 lipoprotein-related parameters was quantified and the logistic LASSO regression algorithm was employed to identify the optimal combination of metabolites-lipoproteins and their ratios to discriminate the groups of interest. Results: In the training set, our model classified AD-dem and MCI with an accuracy of 81.7%. These results were reproduced in the validation set (accuracy 75.0%). Evolution of MCI-AD patients was evaluated over time. Patients who displayed a decrease in MMSE < 1.5 point per year were considered at lower progression rate: we obtained a division in 18 MCI-AD at lower progression rate (MCI-AD LR) and 27 at higher progression rate (MCI-AD HR). The model calculated using 4 metabolic features identified MCI-AD LR and MCI-AD HR with an accuracy of 73.3%. Conclusions: The identification of potential novel peripheral biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease, as proposed in this study, opens a new prospect for an innovative and minimally invasive method to identify AD in its very early stages. We proposed a novel approach able to sub-stratify MCI-AD patients identifying those associated with a faster rate of clinical progression.",Alessia Vignoli,VGNLSS88M42D612Z,200,

Different types of oral anticoagulant drugs can have specific effects on the metabolism of patients. Here we characterize, for the first time, the serum metabolomic and lipoproteomic profiles of AF patients treated with anticoagulants: vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Materials and methods: Serum samples of 167 AF patients (median age 78 years, 62 % males, 70 % on DOACs treatment) were analyzed via high resolution 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Data on 25 metabolites and 112 lipoprotein-related fractions were quantified and analyzed with multivariate and univariate statistical approaches. Key findings: Our data provide evidence that patients treated with VKAs and DOACs present significant differences in their profiles: lower levels of alanine and lactate (odds ratio: 1.72 and 1.84), free cholesterol VLDL-4 subfraction (OR: 1.75), triglycerides LDL-1 subfraction (OR: 1.80) and 4 IDL cholesterol fractions (ORs ∼ 1.80), as well as higher levels of HDL cholesterol (OR: 0.48), apolipoprotein A1 (OR: 0.42) and 7 HDL cholesterol fractions/subfractions (ORs: 0.40–0.51) are characteristic of serum profile of patients on DOACs' therapy. Significance: Our results support the usefulness of NMR-based metabolomics for the description of the effects of oral anticoagulants on AF patient circulating metabolites and lipoproteins. The higher serum levels of HDL cholesterol observed in patients on DOACs could contribute to explaining their reduced cardiovascular risk, suggesting the need of further studies in this direction to fully understand possible clinical implications.",Alessia Vignoli,VGNLSS88M42D612Z,200,

It is addressed not only to NMR specialists, but to all researchers who wish to approach metabolomics with a clear idea of what they wish to achieve but not necessarily with a deep knowledge of NMR. For this reason, some technical parts may seem a bit naïve to the experts. The review starts by describing standard metabolomics procedures, which imply the use of a dedicated 600 MHz instrument and of four properly standardized 1D experiments. Standardization is a must if one wants to directly compare NMR results obtained in different labs. A brief mention is also made of standardized pre-analytical procedures, which are even more essential. Attention is paid to the distinction between fingerprinting and profiling, and the advantages and disadvantages of fingerprinting are clarified. This aspect is often not fully appreciated. Then profiling, and the associated problems of signal assignment and quantitation, are discussed. We also describe less conventional approaches, such as the use of different magnetic fields, the use of signal enhancement techniques to increase sensitivity, and the potential of field-shuttling NMR. A few examples of biomedical applications are also given, again with the focus on NMR techniques that are most suitable to achieve each particular goal, including a description of the most common heteronuclear experiments.

Unlike period-based evaluations, cohort-based schemes require the computation of conditional expectations for which explicit solutions often do not exist. To overcome this issue, we suggest the application of a well-established methodology, i.e., the Least-Squares Monte Carlo approach. The idea is to approximate conditional expectations by combining simulations and regression techniques, thus avoiding a straightforward but computationally demanding nested simulations method. To show the extreme flexibility and generality of the proposal, we provide extensive numerical results concerning two main longevity indices, life expectancy and lifespan disparity, obtained by adopting both single- and multi-population mortality models. Comparisons between period- and cohort-based results are made as well. Finally, the paper shows that the proposed methodology can be used to approximate other biometric indices at future dates for which cohort-based estimations are often replaced by period ones for computational simplicity.",Fabio Viviano,VVNFBA94C03M208Z,200,

Although life expectancy has increased significantly, age-related conditions have become the leading causes of impairment and disability in the elderly, becoming a major global health concern. This highlights the need for innovative, multitarget strategies to modulate the aging process and extend healthspan. In recent years, researchers have explored natural solutions to counteract the hallmarks of aging. Among these, marine-derived molecules represent an up-and-coming niche of bioactive compounds, distinguished by their unique structural diversity and multifunctional properties. Marine products are increasingly studied for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties, targeting key pathways involved in aging, such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, impaired autophagy, and chronic inflammation. In this review, we aim to (i) explore the field of marine-derived bioactive molecules which demonstrated effects on lifespan extension, (ii) summarize studies showing their capacity to target one or more hallmarks of aging, (iii) highlight those that exhibit therapeutic potential in age-related diseases – including neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic, cancer, musculoskeletal, and chronic pulmonary disorders. Their multitarget activity makes them attractive candidates for the prevention or treatment of age-related diseases, and several have shown promising results in preclinical studies. However, only a limited number of these compounds have progressed to late-stage clinical trials, highlighting the need for further translational research, which may pave the way for novel anti-aging therapeutic strategies.",Sara Ristori,RSTSRA92D51A851V,200,

The present study contends that the existing proposals aimed at empowering young people, including the lowering of the voting age, the implementation of age-weighted voting, and the introduction of youth quotas, are inadequate in addressing the fundamental democratic inequities experienced by young individuals. It is important to note that these approaches either misrepresent youth disadvantage as analogous to the structural oppression experienced by historically marginalised groups or rely excessively on electoral means to grant young people meaningful political control. It is argued that the political exclusion of youth is qualitatively distinct, rooted in their temporal marginality and lack of stable group identity over time. In order to address this issue, the introduction of contestation arenas is proposed. These democratic innovations enable citizens to scrutinise and veto political decisions that misrecognise their interests. In contradistinction to deliberative mini publics, these arenas embrace conflict and partiality, thereby allowing politicised interests to challenge representative decisions through structured contestation. The paper posits that contestation arenas offer a medium for active democratic control, political visibility, and symbolic recognition, particularly suited to the modes of participation favoured by younger citizens. By facilitating agency and equal authorship over decisions, such arenas promise a more robust democratic system capable of addressing generational asymmetries without undermining the legitimacy of existing electoral structures.",Enrico Biale,BLINRC81P29A984H,200,

This is not news, but it means that much helpful information and many resources are currently inaccessible to the vast majority of people without the aid of a qualified individual. Chatbots, and more generally conversational agents, can provide assistance and support to users for this task by enabling a dialogue in a natural and colloquial language and providing intelligent answers based on the domain-specific knowledge available. This study sought to explore the state of the art in implementing a conversational system in the legal domain focusing on the main technologies adopted to tackle issues that arise. The search was conducted on four different databases: ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, Web of Science. A total of 1.532 articles were extracted, of which 22 met both the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the screening phase. The results revealed many natural language processing techniques that can enhance conversational agents in the interactions with users’ questions concerning the legal domain. Our article pays particular attention to the underrepresented implementative aspects of such systems and individuates a literature gap in the majority of the solutions proposed that consisted only of a retrieval approach. While retrieval-based systems can efficiently locate and present relevant information from predefined datasets, they often lack the ability to generate the nuanced, context-sensitive responses that are crucial in legal settings. This limitation influences the effectiveness of these agents, as legal inquiries frequently require not just the retrieval of information, but also the ability to interpret and rephrase complex legal language into more understandable terms for the user. These findings pave the way for further research on the subject treated that embrace techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation and explore more suitable approaches for evaluating these systems.",Frida Milella,MLLFRD85P56L049D,200,

Nevertheless, the question of whether specific subgroups of individuals with dementia are more or less likely to benefit from this cognitive stimulation intervention remains unaddressed. Here, we directly compared the effectiveness of the Italian CST (CST-IT), delivered in a previous multicenter controlled clinical trial, across two distinct cohorts of individuals clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease (AD, N = 30) and vascular dementia (VaD, N = 27) in the mild-to-moderate stage. Method: The impact of dementia subtype (AD vs VaD) on immediate (at intervention completion) benefits of CST-IT in general cognitive functioning, communicative abilities, mood, behavior and perceived quality of life was evaluated through linear mixed effects models. The frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline was inserted as a covariate due to the different behavioral profile in the two groups. Exploratory analyses also investigated the potential differential effect of dementia subtype on long-term benefits (three months after intervention). Results: The CST-IT determined comparable immediate, clinically significant improvements in general cognition and communicative abilities. Dementia subtype influenced short-term benefits in depressive symptoms (with a greater decrease in AD patients) and quality of life (no significant impact in AD, and a small improvement in VaD). Such effects depended on diagnosis-related differences in neuropsychiatric symptoms. At long-term, benefits persisted in general cognition (though depending on the outcome considered). Improvements in narratives were seen in VaD, whereas communicative abilities in AD returned to baseline. Post-intervention gains in depressive symptoms persisted in AD, but not in VaD, although benefits in quality of life remained stable in the latter. Conclusions: Different mechanisms of neuropsychological change after CST-IT were hypothesized for the different forms of dementia, particularly with respect to crucial outcomes such as language, mood and quality of life, with implications toward the delivery of such psychosocial intervention in clinical contexts.",Erika Borella,BRLRKE73T59G535J,200,

Here, we repurpose this technology to eradicate aberrant cells by specifically targeting silent and non-functional genomic sequences present only in target cells to be eliminated. Indeed, an intrinsic challenge of most current therapies against cancer and viral infections is the non-specific toxicity that they can induce in normal tissues because of their impact on important cellular mechanisms shared, to different extents, between unhealthy and healthy cells. The CRISPR/Cas9 technology has potential to overcome this limitation; however, so far effectiveness of these approaches was made dependent on the targeting and inactivation of a functional gene product. Here, we generate proof-of-principle evidence by engineering HeLa and RKO cells with a promoterless Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) construct. The integration of this construct simulates either a genomic alteration, as in cancer cells, or a silent proviral genome. Cas9-mediated DSBs in the GFP sequence activate the DNA damage response (DDR), reduce cell viability and increase mortality. This is associated with increased cell size, multinucleation, cGAS-positive micronuclei accumulation and the activation of an inflammatory response. Pharmacological inhibition of the DNA repair factor DNA-PK enhances cell death. These results demonstrate the therapeutic potential of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in eliminating cells with an aberrant genome, regardless of the expression or the function of the target DNA sequence.",Fabrizio D'Adda di Fagagna,DDDFRZ66L28L483G,200,

However, its optimal normalization method remains uncertain. The aim of this cross-sectional study is to compare different normalization approaches for muscle power in predicting self-reported 400 m walking difficulty, used as a proxy of mobility limitation, in community-dwelling older adults (≥65 years old) from the Longevity Check-Up 8+ Study. Methods: Lower limb muscle power was estimated using five-repetition sit-to-stand equations and expressed as i) absolute (W), ii) relative (W/kg), iii) allometric (W/m2), and iv) specific power (W/kg of appendicular skeletal muscle mass). 400-m walking difficulty was self-reported and dichotomized. Discriminative ability was assessed through receiver operating characteristic curves. Associations were tested using logistic regression models. Results: Among the 4614 participants (mean age 72.8 ± 5.8 years; 53.2 % women), 25.1 % reported difficulty walking 400 m. Individuals reporting difficulty were older, more frequently female, had higher body mass index, and lower physical activity levels (all p < 0.001). Relative muscle power demonstrated the highest discriminative ability [area under the curve 0.70; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.68–0.72], outperforming other indices. Optimal cut-offs for relative muscle power identified using the Youden index were 3.1 W/kg in women and 3.8 W/kg in men. Low relative muscle power was significantly associated with greater odds of walking difficulty (odds ratio 2.07; 95 % CI 1.78–2.42; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Relative muscle power showed superior predictive performance for self-reported walking difficulty, as an indicator of mobility limitation, compared to other normalization methods. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore their relevance for other clinically meaningful outcomes.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B,200,

This prospective cohort study was conducted among octogenarians residing in the mountainous Sirente geographic area of Central Italy. Sarcopenia was defined by the coexistence of low muscle mass and dynapenia. Data on fall history and incident falls were collected over a two-year period. A general linear model was used to assess whether intrinsic factors (i.e., multimorbidity, polypharmacy, cognitive function, vision status, nutritional status) and extrinsic factors (i.e., social functioning, environmental characteristics) moderated the relationship between sarcopenia (independent variable) and falls (dependent variable). Data of 364 individuals were examined. Fifty participants (13.7%) reported at least one fall event in the 90 days prior to data collection, while 36 participants (10%) reported having fallen during the follow-up period. Results revealed that intrinsic factors, but not extrinsic ones, significantly influenced this association. Specifically, multimorbidity and polypharmacy were associated with both fall history and incidence, while cognitive function and nutritional status emerged as significant moderators in the longitudinal analysis. In conclusion, these findings underscore the importance of addressing specific intrinsic health-related factors in order to more effectively mitigate the risk of falls among older adults with sarcopenia.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B,200,

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Unconventional settings across Italy. Participants: Italian older adults (65+ years) who provided a written informed consent. Measurements: Physical function was evaluated according to isometric handgrip strength (IHG) and 5-time sit-to-stand (5STS) performances. Muscle power parameters were estimated based on 5STS values. Sarcopenia was operationalized according to the presence of low physical function (i.e., IHG or 5STS), or low muscle power, plus low appendicular skeletal muscle mass. Health parameters included the capacity to perform the 400 m test, adherence to the Mediterranean (MED) diet, practice of physical activity (PA), blood pressure (BP) values, blood concentration of total cholesterol and glucose, verbal fluency, sleep quality, and self-reported health status. Results: Results indicated that sarcopenic indexes had a poor-to-moderate level of agreement. Moreover, results indicated that operationalizing sarcopenia using muscle power measures provided exclusive or stronger associations with health parameters. Specifically, older adults classified as sarcopenic based on muscle power values were less likely to complete the 400-meter walk test, more likely to engage in PA, reported poorer self-rated health, and showed lower adherence to the MED diet. Conclusions: Findings of the present study indicated that sarcopenia indexes based on muscle strength or muscle power capture different aspects of older adults’ health.

This retrospective cross-sectional study investigated the association between subjective sleep quality and probable sarcopenia in a cohort of community-dwelling older adults enrolled in the Longevity Check-Up 8+ study. Methods: Participants were asked about their sleep quality over the past month, with four possible options (“very good”, “quite good”, “quite bad”, very bad”). For the analysis, participants were grouped into good or bad sleep quality categories. Probable sarcopenia was operationalized according to handgrip strength values < 27 kg for men and < 16 kg for women. Logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between sleep quality and probable sarcopenia. Results: 1971 participants were included in the analysis (mean age 73.4 ± 6.2 years, 50.0 % women). Bad sleep quality was reported by 28.3 % of participants and was more prevalent among women, physically inactive individuals, and those with dyslipidemia. Probable sarcopenia was more prevalent in participants with bad sleep quality (23.8 % vs. 18.7 %, p = 0.012). Logistic regression revealed that bad sleep quality was significantly associated with increased odds of probable sarcopenia in both unadjusted (odds ratio [OR] 1.36, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.07–1.72, p = 0.010) and fully adjusted models (OR 1.40, 95 % CI 1.08–1.81, p = 0.011).

Clinically, there are three stages of cognitive decline: dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and subjective cognitive decline. Both MCI and subjective cognitive decline are recognized as risk factors for dementia, but most countries do not recommend specific treatments outside of clinical trials. A key goal of precision medicine is to improve the classification of pathological conditions based on molecular markers rather than relying solely on clinical symptoms. From this perspective, providing a clear and objective identification of conditions that could progress into more severe symptoms while distinguishing them from other types of impairments is crucial for improving early detection of AD. In this work, we propose a clustering-based molecular stratification of MCI patients by analyzing blood transcriptomic data. Unsupervised and supervised approaches were adopted to select features from gene expression data, and deep learningbased autoencoders were applied to embed the data into a lower-dimensional latent space. This latent representation was then fed into a clustering algorithm to determine the final result. The identified MCI patient clusters showed significant molecular, clinical, and pathophysiological differences. Differences were also detected by comparing MCI patient clusters to AD patients and control samples. These findings can lead to an early and precise diagnosis of progressive dementia, offering a more objective alternative to standard cognitive-based definitions.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D,200,

However, sharing or accessing this information outside of their facilities is often hindered by factors such as privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) data systems are emerging to overcome the siloed nature of health data and the barriers to sharing it. While federated approaches have been extensively studied, especially in classification problems, clustering-oriented approaches are still relatively few and less widespread, both in formulating algorithms and in their application in eHealth domains. The primary objective of this paper is to introduce a federated K-means-based approach for clustering tasks within the healthcare domain and explore the impact of heterogeneous health data distributions. The evaluation of the proposed federated K-means approach has been conducted on several health-related datasets through comparison with the centralized version and by estimating the trade-off between privacy and performance. The preliminary findings suggest that in the case of heterogeneous health data distributions, the difference between the centralized and federated approach is marginal, with the federated approach outperforming the centralized one on some healthcare datasets.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D,200,

We investigate how the brain's biological processes and associated multiphysics interact and how this influences the structure and functionality of the brain. We review the literature on brain network models and dynamic processes, highlighting the need for sophisticated mathematical and statistical modelling techniques. Specifically, we go through large-scale brain network models relevant to AD and PD, highlighting the pathological mechanisms and potential therapeutic strategies investigated in the literature. Additionally, we investigate the propagation of CSD in the brain and its implications for neurological disorders. Furthermore, we discuss how data-driven approaches and artificial neural networks refine and validate models related to NDDs. Overall, this review underscores the significance of coupled multiscale models in deciphering disease mechanisms, offering potential avenues for therapeutic development and advancing our understanding of pathological brain dynamics.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D,200,

It is a structured interview that encompasses evaluation across six specific domains. However, AD's initial stages may not lead to a uniform cognitive decline across all cognitive domains. The main aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic utility of individual CDR domains in predicting the progression of AD dementia over a five-year longitudinal period among an elderly cohort. Initially, a longitudinal-cluster analysis was conducted using five-point longitudinal data to categorize subjects into clusters based on the progression of CDR domains during the follow-up. Then, a statistical analysis was performed on the identified clusters to ascertain whether, at the baseline, patients exhibiting stability have different profiles about CDR domains compared to patients who converted to an AD during the whole follow-up period. Results show that the risk of AD progression was mainly related to problems with Orientation and Judgment at the baseline.",Patrizia Ribino,RBNPRZ75E44F061D,200,

A possible explanation for these divergent results is that investigations may not have adjusted their analyses according to the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Objectives: To examine the associations between hypertension-related parameters, ACEI use, and a set of physical performance tests in very old adults. Design: Cross-sectional study from the ilSIRENTE database. Setting: Mountain community of the Sirente geographic area (L’Aquila, Abruzzo, Italy). Participants: All persons born in the Sirente area (13 municipalities) before 1 January 1924 and living in that region at the time of study were identified and invited to participate. The final sample included 364 older adults (mean age: 85.8 ± standard deviation [SD] 4.8). Measurements: Physical performance was assessed using isometric handgrip strength (IHG), walking speed (WS) at normal and fast pace, 5-time sit-to-stand test (5STS), and muscle power measures. Blood pressure (BP) was measured after 20 to 40 min of rest, while participants sat in an upright position. Drugs were coded according to the Anatomical Therapeutic and Chemical codes. ACEIs were categorized in centrally (ACEI-c) and peripherally (ACEI-p) acting. Blood inflammatory markers, free insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) were assayed. Results: Results indicated that 5STS test was significantly and negatively associated with diastolic BP values. However, significance was lost when results were adjusted for ACEI use. Participants on ACEIs were more likely to have greater specific muscle power and higher blood levels of IGFBP-3 than non-ACEI users. When participants were categorized according to ACEI subtypes, those on ACEI-p had higher blood IGF-1 levels compared with ACEI-c users. Conclusions: The main findings of the present study indicate that ACEI use might influence the association between hypertension-related parameters and neuromuscular parameters in very old adults. Such results may possibly be linked to the effects of ACEI-p on the IGF-1 pathway.",RICCARDO CALVANI,CLVRCR81S15H501B,200,

Pharmacological remedies are currently unavailable for preventing the development of sarcopenia, halting its progression, or impeding its negative health outcomes. The most effective strategies to contrast sarcopenia rely on the adoption of healthier lifestyle behaviors, including adherence to high-quality diets and regular physical activity. In this review, the role of nutrition in the prevention and management of sarcopenia is summarized. Special attention is given to current “blockbuster” dietary regimes and agents used to counteract age-related muscle wasting, together with their putative mechanisms of action. Issues related to the design and implementation of effective nutritional strategies are discussed, with a focus on unanswered questions on the most appropriate timing of nutritional interventions to preserve muscle health and function into old age.

In this work, we propose an extension of the traditional k-means clustering for multivariate time series data to cluster joint trajectories of different features describing progression over time. The algorithm we propose here enables the joint analysis of various longitudinal features to explore co-occurring trajectory factors among markers indicative of cognitive decline in individuals participating in an AD progression study. By examining how multiple variables co-vary and evolve together, we identify distinct subgroups within the cohort based on their longitudinal trajectories. Our clustering method enhances the understanding of individual development across multiple dimensions and provides deeper medical insights into the trajectories of cognitive decline. In addition, the proposed algorithm is also able to make a selection of the most significant features in separating clusters by considering trajectories over time. This process, together with a preliminary pre-processing on the OASIS-3 dataset, reveals an important role of some neuropsychological factors. In particular, the proposed method has identified a significant profile compatible with a syndrome known as Mild Behavioral Impairment (MBI), displaying behavioral manifestations of individuals that may precede the cognitive symptoms typically observed in AD patients. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple longitudinal features in clinical modeling, ultimately supporting more effective and individualized patient management strategies.",Davide Chicco,CHCDVD84R18D969F,200,

Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included individuals aged ≥ 75 years with AF, discharged between 2014 and 2018 from three acute geriatric units. Baseline functional and frailty status were collected. OAC use at discharge was identified through review of clinical charts. Data on 1-year survival, IS, and MB/CRNMB were extracted from a centralized database. Associations with 1-year mortality were analyzed using a multivariable Cox model with IS and MB/CRNMB as time-dependent variables. Results: The study included 1684 patients with AF, median age 86 years (interquartile range 82–90), of whom 59.8% were female. Most patients were frail (67.2%) or prefrail (24.2%). Within 1 year, 609 (36.2%) patients died; there were 50 (2.9%) cases of IS and 79 (4.7%) cases of MB/CRNMB. Multivariable Cox analysis showed that incident MB/CRNMB (hazard ratio, HR: 3.82, 95% confidence intervals, CI 2.68–5.45) and IS (HR: 1.82, 95% CI 1.14–2.90) were independently associated with increased 1-year mortality. Conclusions: In total, one third of older adults with AF receiving OAC die within a year of discharge. Incident MB/CRNMB was more strongly associated with reduced survival than incident IS, underscoring the clinical complexity of anticoagulation management in this high-risk population.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

At our hospital, the Osservazione Breve Intensiva Geriatrica (OBI-GER) was established as a dedicated G-SSU. Aims: This study aims to characterize the clinical profile of older adults admitted to OBI-GER and identify factors associated with hospitalization within the first 24 h of admission. Methods: Retrospective, single-center study including individuals aged ≥ 75 years, admitted to OBI-GER between August 2023 and August 2024, with frailty and/or delirium during ED stay. Multivariable logistic regression model with stepwise selection was used to assess associations between hospitalization and clinical, functional, laboratory, and organizational variables. Results: Overall, 353 patients (mean age 86.8 ± 5.5 years, 47.9% male) were included, of whom 109 (30.8%) required hospitalization. The cohort exhibited moderate frailty (median Clinical Frailty Scale = 6, IQR 6–7) and a considerable comorbidity burden (median Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI] = 6, IQR 5–8), along with a high prevalence of dementia (45%) and polypharmacy (mean 7.1 ± 3.4 medications). Independent risk factors for hospitalization included higher CCI (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.35), delirium on the first day of OBI-GER (OR 2.03, 95% CI 1.13–3.64), frequent faller profile (OR 2.66; 95% CI 1.38–5.12), and lower hemoglobin levels at ED admission (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79–0.99). Conclusions: Despite their clinical complexity, only one-third of patients admitted to OBI-GER required hospitalization.

Aims: To estimate the incidence of falls, identify associated risk factors, and evaluate the predictive value of the Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (T-POMA) in a large cohort of NH residents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records from 32 NHs managed by Kos Care company across Italy. Residents aged ≥ 65 years with at least one functional assessment were included. Fall incidence was calculated per 100 person-years. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify predictors of time to first fall. Results: Overall, 754 residents (19.2%) experienced a fall. A T-POMA score ≤ 18 was a strong predictor of falls (HR 2.13; 95% CI: 1.61–2.81), along with age ≥ 85 years (HR 1.39; 1.02–1.90), male sex (HR 1.47; 1.27–1.71), cognitive impairment (HR 1.30; 1.10–1.53), hearing impairment (HR 1.26; 1.01–1.58), mood and behavioural disorders (HR 1.29; 1.09–1.54), and therapies known to increase fall risk (HR 1.29; 1.09–1.52). Poor general health (HR 0.63; 0.52–0.77) and frequent physical restraint (HR 0.70; 0.58–0.86) use were associated with lower fall risk. Severe fall consequences occurred in 15.9% of fallers and were significantly associated with low T-POMA scores and restraint use. Discussion and conclusion: Falls are highly prevalent among Italian NH residents and influenced by multiple clinical and functional factors. These findings support the implementation of multifactorial fall prevention strategies and real-time risk monitoring in NH settings.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the predictive value of CONUT and GNRI score on 36 months mortality and hospitalization risk in hospitalized older patients. Methods: Data of 382 patients (196 women, mean age 80.9±6.8 years) were retrieved from the multicenter Italian Study conducted by the Gruppo Lavoro Italiano Sarcopenia–Trattamento e Nutrizione (GLISTEN) in 12 Acute Care Wards. Sarcopenia was defined as presence of low handgrip strength plus low skeletal mass index (EWGSOP2 criteria). CONUT score was calculated based on serum albumin, total cholesterol and total lymphocyte count, whilst the GNRI was calculated using serum albumin and present body weight/ideal body weight ratio. Results: During the 36-month follow-up, 120 out of 382 participants died (31.4%). From the results of the survival analysis, and after adjustment for potential confounders, participants with CONUT-derived moderate to high risk of malnutrition had shorter survival (HR = 2.67, 95%CI 1.34–5.33 and HR = 3.98, 95% CI: 1.77–8.97, respectively), as well as shorter survival free of urgent hospitalization (HR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.03–3.55 and HR = 1.98; 95% CI: 1.14–3.42, respectively). Conversely, only GNRI indicative of high risk of malnutrition was an independent predictor of mortality 1.96 (95% CI: 1.06–3.62), but not of hospitalization. Conclusion: The CONUT score seems a valid tool to predict long-term mortality and hospitalization risk. Conversely, the GNRI is associated with long-term mortality, but not with hospital readmissions.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

This study aims to evaluate the prescribing practice of psychoactive drugs in older people hospitalized for hip fracture (HF) and to explore independent correlates of deprescribing. Methods: Multicenter prospective observational study including patients with HF admitted to 13 Orthogeriatric wards of the Italian Group of Orthogeriatrics (July 2019-August 2022). Patients underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment. The use of psychoactive drugs associated with a higher risk of falls was assessed using a dedicated checklist. Deprescribing was defined as any reduction in the number of psychoactive drugs upon discharge, and independent correlates of deprescribing were explored using logistic regression analyses. Cluster analysis by Partitioning around Medoids was also performed in the hypothesis that selected clusters of characteristics could be associated with deprescribing. Results: One thousand eight hundred fifty-four older individuals (mean age 84 years, 77% females) were studied; 1190 (64%) were not prescribed any psychoactive drug, while 474 (26%), 129 (7%), and 61 (3%) took 1, 2, 3 or more psychoactive drugs, respectively. Among 664 patients on psychoactive drugs on admission, 177 (27%) had fewer prescriptions at discharge, mainly anxiolytics from 89 to 10 (50–6%), antipsychotics from 49 to 12 (28–7%) and antidepressants from 98 to 28 (55–16%). On the other count, 51 (8%) were prescribed more psychoactive drugs, mostly antidepressants from 25 to 45 (49–88%) and antipsychotics from 7 to 17 (14–17%).

More specifically, the clustering procedure could not improve the characterization of deprescribing; conversely, the deprescribing propensity significantly depended upon the center-specific prescriptive practice, not explained by other clinical-epidemiological factors.

Due to its complexity and heterogeneity, understanding the progression of sepsis across different patient populations remains a significant challenge. In this study, we exploit a sophisticated analytical framework based on k-means multivariate longitudinal clustering to capture the diverse trajectories of sepsis. We do so by analyzing multiple clinical parameters tracked over time, providing a nuanced view of disease progression. By incorporating Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as the distance metric, the proposed method effectively accounts for temporal misalignments and variability in the rate of disease progression, an essential capability given the unpredictable and heterogeneous nature of sepsis. This integration enhances the model’s ability to detect distinct temporal patterns and phenotypic subgroups that may remain undetected using conventional analytical approaches. By leveraging sepsis-related electronic health records (EHRs), which provide rich time-series data on laboratory results along with patient demographics and underlying health conditions, the proposed method reveals distinct sepsis phenotypes that reflect variations in disease progression. We perform several experiments varying the number of clusters and clinical variable combinations, evaluating the clustering performances using Silhouette score, Caliski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index, as reference quality metrics. Our results confirm the prognostic role of the Thrombin-Antigen complex and the Prothrombin Time–International Normalized Ratio for septic patients. Furthermore, to evaluate the relevance of subjects’ stratification, the Adjusted Rand Index metric is used to quantify the survival prediction capability of our longitudinal clustering method, considering the 28-day death feature as the target variable. The same metric demonstrates that our proposal outperforms other longitudinal clustering algorithms available in the literature.",Claudia Di Napoli,DNPCLD65M64F839D,200,

An FI-49 cutoff of 0.33 was also selected to provide clinicians with a more practical approach (C-index of 0.7044, 95% CI 0.6796-0.7292). Conclusion and Implication: The FI-49 is a good predictor of short-term mortality or transition to palliative care among older patients referred to an HC service. The automatic calculation of this tool could facilitate more appropriate care planning and the correct allocation of healthcare resources, especially considering the rapid ageing of the population.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

Currently, the true prevalence of this syndrome is unknown as its detection and management are not standardized in clinical practice. Methods: A multicenter observational cross-sectional study will be conducted nationwide, involving different orthogeriatric units in Spain. The prevalence of delirium will be assessed using the 4AT scale, along with its characteristics and its relationship with other geriatric syndromes, sociodemographic variables, surgical characteristics, and laboratory parameters. Results: Data collection is scheduled to take place on World Delirium Day (Wednesday, March 13, 2024), and therefore, the results are expected during the second or third quarter of 2024. Conclusions: Understanding the real prevalence and characteristics of delirium in older adults with HF could contribute to the development of strategies for its detection and management, reducing the impact of its consequences.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

Although its association with in-hospital mortality has previously been reported, data concerning postdischarge mortality and delirium subtypes are scarce. We evaluated the association between delirium and its subtypes and both in-hospital and postdischarge mortality. Methods: This multicenter longitudinal clinical-based study was conducted in Monza and Brescia, Italy. The study population included 1,324 patients (median age: 68 years) with COVID-19 admitted to 4 acute clinical wards in northern Italy during the first pandemic waves (February 2020 to January 2021). Delirium within 48 hours of hospital admission was assessed through validated scores and/or clinically according to DSM-5 criteria. The association of delirium—and its subtypes—with in-hospital and postdischarge mortality (over a median observation period of 257 [interquartile range: 189–410] days) was evaluated through Cox proportional hazards models. Results: The 223 patients (16.8%) presenting delirium had around 2-fold increased in-hospital (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.38–2.73) and postdischarge (HR = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.48–2.73) mortality than those without delirium. All delirium subtypes were associated with greater risk of death compared to the absence of delirium, but hypoactive delirium revealed the strongest associations with both in-hospital (HR=2.03; 95% CI, 1.32–3.13) and postdischarge (HR=2.22; 95% CI, 1.52–3.26) mortality. Conclusions: In patients with COVID-19, early onset delirium is associated not only with in-hospital mortality but also with shorter postdischarge survival. This suggests that delirium detection and management are crucial to improving the prognosis of COVID-19 patients.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

Knowing the potential danger of these medications in terms of delirium development is key, given the impact that delirium exerts on healthcare and clinical patient’s outcomes. However, medications may also have a favorable effect to prevent and manage it in selected patients. This article reviews the mechanisms of drug-induced delirium, including the role of drugs as both predisposing and precipitating factors and the role of neurotransmitter imbalances involving acetylcholine, dopamine, and gamma aminobutyric acid in the pathophysiology of drug-induced delirium. Furthermore, it discusses the role of polypharmacy as a causing factor of delirium, the scales used to assess the patient’s drug burden of delirium, the medication candidates for delirium prevention, and the medications that may be used to treat delirium.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

However, data are lacking on its prevalence in a heterogeneous group of older patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of dysphagia at admission and at discharge, and its related factors, in particular delirium, in older patients admitted to a rehabilitation setting. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients 65 years and older admitted to a rehabilitation ward after an acute hospitalization. The presence of dysphagia at admission was screened with the 3OZ Test and confirmed by a speech-therapist. The association between clinical factors and dysphagia was investigated with a multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: We included 1040 patients, (65% females, mean age 81.9 ± 7.2 years). The prevalence of dysphagia at admission was 14.8% and 12.8% at discharge, while the prevalence of delirium among patients with dysphagia was of 31.2% vs 6.4% among patients without dysphagia. The severity of dysphagia was moderate. In the multivariate logistic regression, delirium was associated with dysphagia at admission (OR 2.06; Confidence Interval, CI 1.08–3.23) along with a pre-hospital impairment in the Instrumental-Activities-of-Daily-Living (OR-1.26; CI − 1.1; − 1.10), a change in Barthel Index from pre-hospital to hospital admission (OR-1.02; CI − 1.01 to 1.04), comorbidity (OR 1.12; CI 0.94;1.29) and the number of antibiotics (OR-1.63; CI − 1.01;2.62). Conclusion: Delirium was the main factor associated with dysphagia at rehabilitation admission. The study underlines the importance of screening dysphagia in delirious patients and warrants future studies to determine the changes in dysphagia prevalence according to delirium resolution.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

The aim of the study is to comparatively assess the clinical profiles of older patients treated with trazodone or other antidepressants. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved adults aged ≥ 60 years at risk of or affected with COVID-19 enrolled in the GeroCovid Observational study from acute wards, geriatric and dementia-specific outpatient clinics, as well as long-term care facilities (LTCF). Participants were grouped according to the use of trazodone, other antidepressants, or no antidepressant use. Results: Of the 3396 study participants (mean age 80.6 ± 9.1 years; 57.1% females), 10.8% used trazodone and 8.5% others antidepressants. Individuals treated with trazodone were older, more functionally dependent, and had a higher prevalence of dementia and BPSD than those using other antidepressants or no antidepressant use. Logistic regression analyses found that the presence of BPSD was associated with trazodone use (odds ratio (OR) 28.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 18-44.7 for the outcome trazodone vs no antidepressants use, among participants without depression; OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.05-4.49 for the outcome trazodone vs no antidepressants use, among participants with depression). A cluster analysis of trazodone use identified three clusters: cluster 1 included mainly women, living at home with assistance, multimorbidity, dementia, BPSD, and depression; cluster 2 included mainly institutionalized women, with disabilities, depression, and dementia; cluster 3 included mostly men, often living at home unassisted, with better mobility performance, fewer chronic diseases, dementia, BPSD, and depression. Discussion: The use of trazodone was highly prevalent in functionally dependent and comorbid older adults admitted to LTCF or living at home. Clinical conditions associated with its prescription included depression as well as BPSD.",Giuseppe  Bellelli,BLLGPP63A29B157A,200,

However, the lack of a standardised framework and inconsistent interpretations of key constructs hinder meaningful comparison across studies and contexts. This article presents a systematically derived framework and structured dataset that capture the constructs, measurement approaches and methodological advancements involved in operationalising healthy ageing. The framework and dataset originate from the systematic review conducted by Piriu et al. (2025), which comprehensively maps the range of concepts, constructs and operational dimensions – measures, metrics, instruments and scales – used in 55 empirical studies that operationalise healthy ageing, each addressing at least two of the three core domains identified by the World Health Organization: intrinsic capacity (IC), functional ability (FA) and the environment (ENV). The Piriu et al. (2025) framework (hereafter PIETHA) introduces a multilayered categorisation of the healthy ageing construct, articulating it into three domains (IC, FA, ENV), 15 sub-domains, and 84 themes. This structure reflects both conceptual and measurement considerations (e.g. subjective vs. objective categories, self-reported vs. assessed/tested) while also providing a novel, detailed organisation of the environmental factors shaping healthy ageing at different levels of analysis (micro, meso and macro). Reflecting this multidimensional structure, the dataset complements the framework by documenting the specific tools employed in healthy ageing operationalisation, including assessment scales, validated instruments and measurement methodologies. By systematically analysing how healthy ageing is operationalised across disciplines, the PIETHA framework and related dataset support the identification of conceptual, empirical and methodological gaps in healthy ageing research. This enables researchers to generate new hypotheses, explore underrepresented areas – such as environmental and psychosocial dimensions – and advance integrative metrics. The framework and dataset also enhance methodological transparency and data reuse due to a structured design anchored in thematic identification, construct classification and comprehensive mapping of measurement practices. This facilitates replication, comparison and innovation in the field by enabling the systematic evaluation of interconnected factors and measurement strategies across studies and contexts. The framework and dataset offer a foundational resource to support the harmonisation of healthy ageing metrics and research strategies. They allow researchers and practitioners to: (i) obtain a structured overview of the concepts, constructs and measurement approaches used in healthy ageing research; (ii) assess the strengths and limitations of existing frameworks and methods, and compare approaches across domains and contexts to ensure we measure what matters; and (iii) address persistent gaps and develop the operational evidence base, especially concerning the contextual factors that enable healthy ageing and longevity. Ultimately, the dataset supports the continued development of robust, context-sensitive knowledge and methods for monitoring healthy ageing globally.",Andreea Alexandra Piriu,PRINRL91L57Z129L,200,

Selenoprotein T (SELENOT) plays a crucial role in cardiomyocyte differentiation and protection, but its role in cardiomyocyte senescence remains unknown. Here, we explore the novel role of SELENOT in preserving cardiomyocyte viability and genomic integrity during doxorubicin-induced senescence. Senescent differentiated cardiomyocytes exhibit hallmarks of cellular senescence, including increased β-galactosidase activity and elevated p53 and p21 levels, and upregulation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) markers (i.e. MMP3, IL6, and TNFα). Additionally, senescent cells displayed disrupted cytosolic and mitochondrial redox homeostasis, which were mitigated by PSELT (a small peptide that mimics SELENOT activity). Notably, PSELT positively influenced DNA damage markers (p-γH2AX and lamin B1) and prevented ER stress regulating BIP, calnexin, IRE1α, and ERO1α expression. Intriguingly, SELENOT expression was upregulated in response to senescence, suggesting a stress-sensing redoxin function. Loss-of-function studies revealed that SELENOT deficiency led to cardiomyocyte death and DNA damage, which were only partially rescued by PSELT, supporting the existence of cross-regulatory mechanisms within the SELENOT/PSELT axis. Mechanistically, similar to SSO, an irreversible inhibitor of CD36, PSELT mitigated the senescence-induced upregulation of CD36, a key player in cardiac aging. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that SELENOT interacts with CD36 in both normal and senescent human cardiomyocytes. Overall, these findings underscore the essential role of SELENOT in preserving the viability and genomic integrity of senescent human cardiomyocytes and suggest that PSELT-mediated inhibition of CD36 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating age-related cardiac dysfunction.",Giuseppe  Passarino,PSSGPP64A07D086R,200,

Hand gestures act as a medium between a person's intention and machine control. EMG data is collected from the arm to understand hand motions and accurately predict hand gestures for increased productivity and usability in various devices. However, as EMG data is sensitive and can reveal personal information, federated learning (FL) can be used to preserve security and privacy. FL allows for the creation of a decentralized model using EMG data from multiple participants without compromising confidentiality. In this paper, we first classify data by using machine learning algorithms, k -Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree(DT), Random Forest(RF), Gaussian Naive Bayes(GNB), Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA), and Artificial Neural Network(ANN). The UCI2019 EMG dataset collected from the Myo Thalmic armband is utilized for training and evaluation. The data is split into 80 % for training and 20 % for the testing set. The best classifier with the highest accuracy for predictions is selected through various performance criteria, including accuracy, precision, F1 score, and recall. Results show that the Random Forest method performed the best, with an accuracy rate ranging from 99 % to 100 %. In the second part of the paper, we propose preparing different models by splitting the dataset into public and private data, focusing on exploring heterogeneous federated learning. We suggest that these models can be developed using transfer learning and knowledge distillation techniques, which would help protect the privacy of the participant's data. By incorporating each participant's unique model into the central training model, a significant improvement in the accuracy of the hand gesture detection system can be achieved. Importantly, this approach would address intellectual privacy concerns.",Giovanni Paragliola,PRGGNN85S19F839Y,200,

Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can address these issues by supporting these processes avoiding risky situations, and preventing patients’ and clinicians’ safe. This article presents an artificial intelligence-based architecture for risk management during the nuclear medical examination to automatically guide the patients during the medical examination and support injury prevention. The architecture comprises two main components; the first component integrates Deep Learning (DL) techniques and WiFi tools to monitor and verify the patient's position continuously; the second integrates Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to guide the patient during his/her examination. Experimental results show the suitability of the proposed architecture. Therefore the proposed risk management system can support the prevention of risks and injuries during medical examination and reduce operational costs.",Giovanni Paragliola,PRGGNN85S19F839Y,200,

Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate and assess the performance and behavior of a federated model during the occurrence of catastrophic forgetting events within the context of a non-stationary data scenario. Methods: To achieve this objective, the performance of a proposed federated learning approach has been evaluated in terms of the continuous flow of data in order to train a time series-based model. Results and Conclusion: The results demonstrate the goodness of the solution in terms of performance, with improvements ranging from 2% to 28%. This indicates the benefits that the proposed approach brings to a node in terms of recovering from a catastrophic forgetting event, also taking into account the fact that the probability of catastrophic forgetting is higher at the beginning of the learning process.",Giovanni Paragliola,PRGGNN85S19F839Y,200,

In this context, they constitute part of the body’s first line of defence, acting in concert with immune cells to counter a broad spectrum of external and internal stressors (exposomes), potentially fuelling chronic low-grade inflammation (inflammaging). The levels of the above-mentioned molecules in the blood or local tissues result altered in a range of age-associated pathologies and have been proposed as potential diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers, although they generally lack specificity for a single pathological condition. Evidence from in silico analyses further suggests that most of these molecules may be regulated by members of the microRNA-29 family, pointing towards hierarchical epigenetic mechanisms that merit detailed investigation as potential contributors to ageing-related biomarker signatures. Despite research advances, the identification of robust biomarkers capable of predicting disease onset at the individual level, an essential prerequisite for precise geromedicine, remains an elusive goal in clinical practice. Although individuals differ biologically, this does not preclude the existence of overarching principles that could be reflected in hierarchical biomarkers. Within this framework, a pragmatic strategy for immediate application may involve the systematic use of currently available longitudinal data, for example, from hospitalised patients or through dedicated software programs utilised by general practitioners.",Miriam Capri,CPRMRM64R63D166U,200,

The identification of biomarkers reliably associated with frailty could provide more information on the actual health status and outcome of older subjects. To this aim, we investigated possible associations of four biomarkers related to age and age-related diseases, namely GDF15, FGF21, sRAGE, and NfL, with frailty, measured using frailty index (FI), in community-dwelling subjects of different age. The study was conducted on a cohort of 463 subjects (50–113 years) enrolled before the Covid-19 pandemic and categorized as frail and non-frail, based on a 45-item FI, according to the deficit accumulation model. Plasma levels of the four biomarkers were analysed by Ella Automated ELISA and investigated for their possible association with FI. A Random Forest Decision model was used to assess the biomarkers’ discrimination power with respect to FI. In our cohort, FI was associated with plasma levels of GDF15, NfL and FGF21, but not sRAGE. The first two were also associated with survival. The model based on those four biomarkers estimated frailty with 82 % accuracy. Moreover, frailty estimate obtained with this model led to a more refined prediction of survival on a 3-year follow-up. Our data suggest that GDF15, NfL, FGF21 and sRAGE plasma levels can be proposed as parameters to provide additional information about frailty status and survival with respect to FI in community-dwelling subjects.",Stefano  Salvioli,SLVSFN66D16B819H,200,

We aimed to assesscardiovascular events (CVE) in children with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). Methods: We retrospectively collected data from a case series of 22 children with high-risk medulloblastoma/PNET admitted to the Santobono-Pausilipon Hospital, Naples, Italy from 2008 to 2016. All patients received the Milan HART protocol for high-risk brain malignancies as first line treatment (induction phase), followed by a consolidation phase with Thiotepa and hematopoietic stem cells transplantation, except for 1 patient who received the Milan HART as second line therapy. Four patients also received second line treatment, while 4 patients also received maintenance therapy. Patients underwent cardiac examination, including ECG, echocardiography and serum biomarkers, before antineoplastic treatment initiation and then when clinically needed. Six patients developed CVE (CVE group); 16 patients had no CVE (NO-CVE group). Findings: In the CVE group, 3 patients presented acute CVE during chemotherapy (2 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, 1 patient with arterial hypertension), while 3 patients presented chronic CVE after chemotherapy completion (2 patients with LV dysfunction, 1 patient with ectopic atrial tachycardia). After a 51 months median follow-up, 9 patients died: 4 from the CVE group (in 2 cases heart failure-related deaths) and 5 from the NO-CVE group (progression of disease). Interpretation: A relevant percentage of children treated for medulloblastoma/PNET develops CVE. Heart failure potentially due to chemotherapy may represent a cause of death. Hence, in these patients, strict cardiac surveillance is essential. Funding: No funding was associated with this study.",Alessandra Cuomo,CMULSN91P66F839H,200,

Within this perspective, we aimed to review the effects of prolonged spaceflight on immune-neuroendocrine systems, brain and brain-gut axis, cardiovascular system and musculoskeletal apparatus, highlighting in particular the similarities with an accelerated aging process. In particular, spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy/sarcopenia and bone loss, vascular and metabolic changes, hyper and hypo reaction of innate and adaptive immune system appear to be modifications shared with the aging process. Most of these modifications are mediated by molecular events that include oxidative and mitochondrial stress, autophagy, DNA damage repair and telomere length alteration, among others, which directly or indirectly converge on the activation of an inflammatory response. According to the inflammaging theory of aging, such an inflammatory response could be a driver of an acceleration of the normal, physiological rate of aging and it is likely that all the systemic modifications in turn lead to an increase of inflammaging in a sort of vicious cycle. The most updated countermeasures to fight these modifications will be also discussed in the light of their possible application not only for astronauts’ benefit, but also for older adults on the ground.",Miriam Capri,CPRMRM64R63D166U,200,

The NLRP3 inflammasome and its adaptor protein ASC are critical to initiating and sustaining inflammatory responses in the central nervous system. Although acute inflammasome activation supports host defence responses, chronic activation has been linked to the pathogenesis of PD. Increasing evidence indicates that mutations in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2), particularly the PD-associated G2019S mutation, enhance inflammatory signalling in microglia and peripheral immune cells. However, how LRRK2 intersects with the NLRP3 pathway remains unclear. Here, we investigate the role of LRRK2-G2019S in the priming and activation of the inflammasome in mouse primary microglia and human monocyte-derived microglia-like cells (hMDMi). Under unstimulated conditions, LRRK2-G2019S microglia displayed elevated NLRP3 expression and spontaneous formation of ASC specks within the nucleus, a subcellular localization not previously reported in microglia. Nuclear ASC specks also emerged in Wild Type microglia and hMDMi after lipopolysaccharide priming, but progressed to cytosolic ASC specks and IL-1β release only after canonical activation of NLRP3. These findings suggest that nuclear ASC specks mark a primed state of inflammasome activation in microglia. The LRRK2-G2019S mutation enhances this phenotype, potentially predisposing microglia to exaggerated inflammatory responses. This work identifies a novel cellular feature associated with PD-linked LRRK2 and uncovers a previously unrecognized layer of inflammasome regulation in microglia, offering new avenues to understand and target neuroinflammation in PD.",Luca Ballotto,BLLLCU98P02M089A,200,

Although placental growth factor (PlGF) is important for vascular growth and endothelial function, its role in HPS is unclear. This study investigated the involvement of PlGF in experimental models of HPS and in patients. Methods: Circulating PlGF levels were measured in 64 controls and 137 patients with liver disease, with or without HPS. Two rat models, common bile duct ligation (CBDL) and long-term partial portal vein ligation (PPVL), were used. Plgf-knockout (Plgf–/–) rats were generated using CRISPR-Cas9. Lung RNA-sequencing analysis was performed in the CBDL model. The effects of PlGF on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were also investigated. Results: Circulating PlGF levels were significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis compared with healthy controls (29.4 ± 1.2 vs. 20.2 ± 0.8 pg/ml, p <0.0001), but no difference were found between patients with and without HPS. PlGF levels were not elevated in patients with extrahepatic portal hypertension. In Plgf–/– rats, there was a protective effect against CBDL-induced HPS, whereas PPVL-induced HPS severity remained unchanged. RNA sequencing coupled with ingenuity pathway analysis identified significant interactions between PlGF and pulmonary eNOS activity. Following CBDL, Plgf–/– rats showed decreased pulmonary eNOS activity and reduced circulating nitric oxide metabolites. In vitro, PlGF stimulation enhanced eNOS activity in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, whereas PlGF knockdown led to a decrease. Conclusions: These findings indicate that PlGF aggravates cirrhosis-induced HPS through modulation of pulmonary eNOS activity, and is not involved in HPS from extrahepatic portal hypertension. Impact and implications: This study identified PlGF as a significant contributor to the exacerbation of HPS associated with cirrhosis, through its regulation of pulmonary nitric oxide production. Our findings demonstrated that PlGF deficiency mitigates the severity of both cirrhosis and HPS in the CBDL model, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in cirrhosis-induced HPS. Notably, this protective effect was absent in the PPVL model, which induces HPS associated with portal hypertension without cirrhosis. These results open avenues for novel pharmacological interventions aiming to improve outcomes for patients with cirrhosis-induced HPS.",Alessandra Cuomo,CMULSN91P66F839H,200,

Methods: We investigated HFA/ICOS risk stratification, prescriptions of cardioactive drugs, and occurrence of CV events in a multicentric breast cancer (BC) cohort from 3 Italian Outpatient Cardio-Oncology Clinics. Results: 373 BC patients who underwent a baseline Cardio-Oncologic evaluation were included, of whom 202 scheduled to receive anthracyclines and 171 anti-HER2. Mean age was 60 ± 12 years and 49% of BC patients had ≥2 CV risk factors. In the anthracyclines group, 51% were at low-risk, 43% at medium-risk and 6% at high-risk; while in the anti-HER2 group, 27% patients were at low-risk, 58% at medium-risk and 15% at high-risk. In both groups, a medium-to-high risk was associated with use of cardioactive therapies (p < 0.0001). There were no LVD events in anthracycline recipients, and 16 LVD among anti-HER2 patients. A medium-to-high risk was not associated with LVD occurrence (p = 0.17).

We aimed to assesscardiovascular events (CVE) in children with medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET). Methods: We retrospectively collected data from a case series of 22 children with high-risk medulloblastoma/PNET admitted to the Santobono-Pausilipon Hospital, Naples, Italy from 2008 to 2016. All patients received the Milan HART protocol for high-risk brain malignancies as first line treatment (induction phase), followed by a consolidation phase with Thiotepa and hematopoietic stem cells transplantation, except for 1 patient who received the Milan HART as second line therapy. Four patients also received second line treatment, while 4 patients also received maintenance therapy. Patients underwent cardiac examination, including ECG, echocardiography and serum biomarkers, before antineoplastic treatment initiation and then when clinically needed. Six patients developed CVE (CVE group); 16 patients had no CVE (NO-CVE group). Findings: In the CVE group, 3 patients presented acute CVE during chemotherapy (2 patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, 1 patient with arterial hypertension), while 3 patients presented chronic CVE after chemotherapy completion (2 patients with LV dysfunction, 1 patient with ectopic atrial tachycardia). After a 51 months median follow-up, 9 patients died: 4 from the CVE group (in 2 cases heart failure-related deaths) and 5 from the NO-CVE group (progression of disease). Interpretation: A relevant percentage of children treated for medulloblastoma/PNET develops CVE. Heart failure potentially due to chemotherapy may represent a cause of death. Hence, in these patients, strict cardiac surveillance is essential. Funding: No funding was associated with this study.",Alessandra Cuomo,CMULSN91P66F839H,200,

A complex process common in the elderly, known as immunosenescence, is characterized by a decreased ability to respond to vaccination as well as an increased risk of bacterial and viral infections, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. These processes are associated with alterations in the innate and adaptive immune system and lead to a condition of chronic low-grade inflammation, referred to as inflammaging. However, the mechanisms underlying these processes are still unclear. Several types of immune cells are involved in this condition, including CD4+ T cells subsets. T follicular helper (TFH) cells and T follicular regulatory cells (TFR) can be found in peripheral blood and lymphoid organs and are involved in maintaining immune homeostasis by regulating antibody production by B cells. Age-related changes in TFH cells phenotype and function have been observed in both aging humans and mouse models. Cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, prevalent in elderly subjects, are associated with dysfunctional TFH cells and an altered TFH/TFR ratio. This review discusses the cellular and molecular alterations in TFH cells and in their ratio to TFR cells that occur with age, along with recent findings suggesting a possible link between TFH cells and/or their subsets and cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.",Veronica De Rosa,DRSVNC79S54F839X,200,

These people will be in fact at higher (or lower) risk for many different age-associated diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, cancer, etc. In turn, patients suffering from these diseases are biologically older than healthy age-matched individuals. Many biomarkers that correlate with age have been described so far. The aim of the present review is to discuss the usefulness of some of these biomarkers (especially soluble, circulating ones) in order to identify frail patients, possibly before the appearance of clinical symptoms, as well as patients at risk for age-associated diseases. An overview of selected biomarkers will be discussed in this regard, in particular we will focus on biomarkers related to metabolic stress response, inflammation, and cell death (in particular in neurodegeneration), all phenomena connected to inflammaging (chronic, low-grade, age-associated inflammation). In the second part of the review, next-generation markers such as extracellular vesicles and their cargos, epigenetic markers and gut microbiota composition, will be discussed. Since recent progresses in omics techniques have allowed an exponential increase in the production of laboratory data also in the field of biomarkers of age, making it difficult to extract biological meaning from the huge mass of available data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches will be discussed as an increasingly important strategy for extracting knowledge from raw data and providing practitioners with actionable information to treat patients.",Benedetta Nacmias,NCMBDT60S58D612M,200,

Materials and methods: Thirty-three Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), 32 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 14 AD demented (AD-d) patients underwent plasma p-tau181 analysis with SiMoA assay. Twenty-six SCD, 32 MCI and 14 AD-d patients also underwent CSF biomarkers analysis (Aβ1–42, Aβ1–42/1–40, p-tau, t-tau) and were classified as carriers of AD pathology (AP+) when A+ was associated with T+ (regardless of N), or non-carriers (AP-) when they were A- (regardless of T and N), or A+/T-/N-, or A+/T-/N+ according to the A/T(N) system. Results: Plasma p-tau181 levels were higher in SCD AP+ than in SCD AP- (2.85 ± 0.53 vs 1.73 ± 0.64, p < 0.001), and in MCI AP+ than in MCI AP- (4.03 ± 1.07 vs 2.04 ± 0.87, p < 0.001). In a multivariate linear regression analysis, AP status was the only variable that influenced plasma p-tau181 (B = 1.670 [95% CI 1.097:2.244], p < 0.001). Plasma p-tau181 was highly accurate for discriminating between AP+ and AP- patients (AUC = 0.910). We identified a cut-off level of 2.69 pg/mL to distinguish between AP+ and AP- (sensibility 0.86, specificity 0.82, PPV 75.00% NPV 90.32%). Conclusions: Plasma p-tau181 levels were influenced by the presence of underlying AD pathology, independently from the cognitive status and were highly accurate in differentiating SCD-MCI patients who were carriers of AD pathology from non-carriers.

To unravel the underlying mechanisms of these conditions, this comprehensive review explores the impact of the space “exposome” on the twelve hallmarks of ageing. Through a meticulous analysis encompassing both space environments and terrestrial analogs, we aim to decipher how different conditions influence ageing hallmarks. Utilizing PubMed, we identified 189 studies and 60 meet screening criteria. Research on biological ageing in space has focused on genomic instability, chronic inflammation, and deregulated nutrient sensing. Spaceflight consistently induces genomic instability, linked to prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation, triggers pro-inflammatory and immune alterations, resembling conditions in isolated simulations. Nutrient sensing pathways reveal increased systemic insulin-like growth-factor-1. Microbiome studies indicate imbalances favoring opportunistic species during spaceflight. Telomere dynamics present intriguing patterns, with lengthening during missions and rapid shortening upon return. Despite a pro-ageing trend, some protective mechanisms emerge. Countermeasures, encompassing dietary adjustments, prebiotics, postbiotics, symbiotics, tailored exercises, meditation, and anti-inflammatory supplements, exhibit potential. Spaceflight's impact on ageing is intricate, with diverse findings challenging established beliefs.

Direct RNA (dRNA) sequencing by Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) allows the detection of Us and, thus, facilitates the unveiling of edited Cs avoiding Reverse Transcription and PCR amplification steps. However, dRNA data are noisy, and very rare events such as C-to-U conversions cannot be easily distinguished from background noise or mutation errors. To overcome this issue, we developed a novel machine-learning strategy based on the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm to denoise the signal deriving from dRNA highly-informative ONT data. Here we present a step-by-step protocol illustrating the usage of the C-to-U-Classifier package and how to apply its pretrained iForest models for ameliorating the detection of C-to-U events in mammalian transcriptomes. As an example, we show here the whole pipeline in action on data deriving from wild-type (WT) and APOBEC1 knock-out (KO) macrophagic cell lines.

The system consists of a crib-sized mattress covered with a coated fitted sheet (CFS), created via screen printing of a graphene nanoplatelet (GNP)-based ink onto fabric. The coated fabric exhibited piezoresistive behavior, with gauge factors of 9.9 (in the wale direction) and 1.2 (in the course direction) at a 2.7% strain. Voltage data, acquired using an ERT-inspired protocol, were analyzed through machine learning (ML) models to identify sleep positions, including potentially hazardous ones associated with conditions, such as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The system was calibrated through experiments with a wooden cube and a wooden dummy, supported by finite element method (FEM) simulations to replicate the fabric’s mechanical and electromechanical behavior, enabling synthetic training data generation. Final validation of the CFS involved testing with a lifelike infant mannequin under three conditions: direct contact with the sensorized sheet, the presence of a blanket interposed between the mannequin and the sheet, and induced electrode malfunctions. The classification framework included: 1) general posture recognition (supine, lateral, and face-down); 2) detailed classification (DC) of 30 specific postures, including hazardous ones; and 3) a hierarchical strategy to improve classification robustness and generalization. The system achieved 99.4% accuracy in direct contact and 94.8% with a blanket placed between the mannequin and the sheet, confirming its robustness for real-world monitoring. The proposed solution offers a nonintrusive, scalable, and privacy-preserving alternative to traditional monitoring methods.",Nicola Pesce,PSCNCL93L07H501Q,200,

The approach proposed in this work, based on impedance spectroscopy and supervised machine learning (ML), addresses this need by a novel solution to a multiclass classification problem of cross-contaminations in aviation lubricant. Impedance measurements were performed at room temperature by immersing a microfabricated sensor in 16 aged oil samples containing increasing concentrations of water and aviation fuel. Two datasets were constructed: the first based on impedance components spectra and the second based on dissipation factor spectra. A data pre-processing and augmentation method was proposed for generating synthetic examples from the measured data. Both datasets were independently used to train three supervised classifiers, whose performance was evaluated based on three different approaches of dataset split ratio and k-fold cross-validation. The 1-nearest neighbors (NN) classifier proved to be the most effective in reducing false positives (FPs), false negatives (FNs), and computational running time. The best results were obtained by employing a split ratio of 60:40 and threefold cross-validation scheme on the impedance components-based dataset, yielding an accuracy of 99.8%.",Elisa Sciurti,SCRLSE91S67Z133L,200,

The system's sensing principle leverages the permittivity change of a miniaturized interdigital capacitor (IDC) while immersed in oil. The time-domain impedance concept, that is, the impulse response (IR), is exploited by using maximum length sequences (MLSs) as efficient broadband signals for the sensor's excitation in a wide range of frequencies. Different from conventional impedance spectroscopy (IS), MLS-based measurements are performed with simpler hardware, higher computational efficiency, lower power consumption, and lower measurement time. As a novelty with respect to the state-of-the-art, this article introduces a linear model to relate a single measured quantity from the IR to water concentration in oil. This permits to reduce the digital processing operations, leading to low measurement time and, thus, to low energy-per-measurement parameters with respect to other works which rely on laboratory instrumentation. The validity of the linear model, for the detection of small concentrations of water in lubricant oil, has been verified through experimental measurements. Water-oil samples have been prepared with 0.2 vol%, 0.5 vol%, 1 vol%, 2 vol%, and 3 vol% water concentrations at room temperature, obtaining an estimated limit of detection (LOD) of 6.3 ppm. A low measurement time of 18 ms has been achieved which advances the state-of-the-art.",Elisa Sciurti,SCRLSE91S67Z133L,200,

An international survey dedicated to breast cancer survivors investigated patients’ preferences and expectations. Methods: An international survey was drafted jointly with breast cancer patient advocates from the United States (n = 6) and Europe (n = 2). The survey was validated with 33 questions divided into four themes: demographic data, oncological outcomes, patient views and financial issues. The survey was sent to breast cancer survivors. All information provided was anonymized. Results: From 06/24 to 10/24, 105 patients answered the online survey. The common patient profile was a white (76 %), married (61.5 %), Christian (58.8 %), US-resident (70.2 %) woman aged between 61 and 70 (62.2 %). Long-term outcomes were perceived as being well established for SM (51.5 %) and 2ndBCT (17.1 %). Breast re-irradiation was considered at risk of complications (65.7 %), and 63 % of the patients thought that 2ndBCT provides a more acceptable body self-image. 2ndBCT was expected to give superior cosmetic outcomes than SM with breast reconstruction (55.4 %). Having enough information and ample time to consider the pros and cons of treatment options were very important/important for 99 % and 96.2 %, respectively. Treatment choice was not influenced by financial concerns for 68.3 %. Conclusion: Patient perspective is very important in the decision-making process regarding salvage treatments.

A variety of devices are currently in use. However, the significance of lost markers is poorly understood, and their impact on clinical decisions is unclear. Materials and methods: Among participants enrolled in the prospective AXSANA cohort study, those planned for target lymph node biopsy (TLNB) or targeted axillary dissection (TAD) with completed post-NACT locoregional therapy (surgery and radiotherapy) by January 21, 2025, were included. Results: In 88 of 1528 patients (5.8 %), axillary markers could not successfully be removed during surgery after NACT. The lost marker rate differed depending on the marker type (metallic clip/coil 7.0 %, carbon 3.1 %, radar reflector 1.4 %, magnetic seed 0.6 %, radioactive seed 0.0 %, p < 0.001). Additional postoperative imaging was performed in 25 (28.4 %) and further surgery to remove axillary markers was performed in 6 (6.8 %) patients with lost markers. The proportion of patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (46.6 % versus 36.5 %, p 0.069) and axillary radiotherapy (51.1 % versus 50.2 %, p 0.748) did not differ between patients with and without lost markers. After an average follow-up of 21.8 months, axillary recurrences occurred in 3 patients (3.3 %) with and 16 patients (1.0 %) without lost markers (rate ratio 2.89, p 0.088).

The authors analysed patient- and treatment-related risk factors to create the LyBra score, to identify patients that may benefit the most from BCRL preventive interventions. Materials and methods: Patients were selected from cases of breast cancer treated from January 2019 to July 2022. Inclusion criteria were age above 18, breast cancer diagnosis and surgical treatment with lymph-node biopsy or axillary dissection. Recurrent cancers, inflammatory cancer, previous axillary surgery, bilateral cases and patients with primary lymphedema were excluded. Selected cases were assessed with the LyBra Score. Numerosity and distribution of expected BCRL were compared to the BCRL registered during the minimum follow-up of 2 years. Results: During an average 41 months follow-up (range, 24–62), 131 cases (14 %) of BCRL were registered in the total 933 patients included in the study. According to LyBra score, expected BCRL cases were 149 (16 %), slightly higher but with no statistical significance. The major incidence of BCRL (40 cases in 47 patients) was registered in the high-risk group that included 5 % of the study population. A ROC curve was used to determine the diagnostic performance of the LyBra score and the AUC was 0.78 corresponding to a good discriminating ability. Conclusion: By sorting patients into risk groups, the LyBra score offers a solution to the actual dilemma of timing and indication of the modern preventive-BCRL microsurgeries.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q,200,

To address the complexity and variety of clinical presentation of this type of deformity, a wide assortment of different surgical approaches has been proposed. The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of high-cohesivity silicone gel texturized anatomical implants in correcting lower pole constricted breast, emphasizing implant choice and the role of implant features on patient outcomes. Methods: The study retrospectively analyzed data from 468 Caucasian female patients treated from March 2009 to July 2022 for type I and II tuberous breast deformities. Surgical correction involved the use of extensive radial and horizontal scoring to release lower pole strictures and high-cohesiveness microtextured anatomical implants placement in a subfascial pocket. Major and minor complications during the follow-up were recorded. Results: Implant volume ranged from 260cc to 495cc with an average of 345cc. We report minimal major complications (Baker grade III–IV capsular contracture 4.2%, implant rotation 1.4%) within a mean follow-up time of 60 months. Further implant-related complications including bottoming out, double-bubble deformity, and wrinkling were not observed. Conclusions: The selected surgical approach for correcting lower pole constricted breasts using high-cohesivity silicone gel texturized anatomical implants proves to be effective, offering predictable and satisfying outcomes for patients. The surgical approach, combining anatomical implant characteristics with precise lower pole expansion techniques, yielded stable, esthetically pleasing results that positively impacted patients' quality of life.

One of the newer techniques for breast volume replacement to achieve symmetry and cosmesis is the use of fascio-cutaneous pedicled chest wall perforator flaps or local perforator flaps (CWPF). Case presentation: We present a case of reconstruction with internal mammary artery perforator (IMAP)-based plug flap to fill the infero-medial defect caused by a tumor close to skin, with visible retraction. Clinical discussion: A 52 years old woman, with an extensive palpable mass (3 cm) in the lower medial quadrant of the right breast, the tumor was close to skin, with visible retraction. The patient has small and round breasts, without ptosis. Conclusion: In this situation and when there is skin that needs to be removed, reconstruction can be done with a pedicle flap skin paddle; the IMAP flap is an ideal donor site in these cases. It is a safe flap with good vascularization and offers a great cosmetic result.",Nicola Rocco,RCCNCL81D11F839Q,200,

The present study aims to offer a further contribute to the topic by presenting our personal experience with an implant-guided tailor-made mastopexy technique to manage moderate breast ptosis and hypotrophy. Methods: A retrospective analysis of our database was carried out, and a total of 194 women who underwent a tailor-made resection pattern mastopexy plus implant from November 2016 to December 2021 were enrolled. All patients included in the study presented breast hypoplasia and ptosis classified as Regnault grade II. At the first-year follow-up visit, patients received an anonymous written questionnaire that addressed their self-perception of cosmetic results and overall satisfaction. Results: The technique presented in the study showed a favorable safety profile with a total complication rate accounting for an 8.2% and an overall reoperation rate as low as 4.6%. Major concerns including wound dehiscence, implant exposure, and nipple necrosis are not reported. Patients’ self-reported outcomes revealed high satisfaction rates and stable results in the long-term follow-up. Conclusions: The described approach ensures proper reshaping together with the desired increased breast volume minimizing the chance of implant exposure due to wound dehiscence or any sort of tissue necrosis from devascularized skin edges.

This Delphi survey investigates the opinion of an expert panel about the decision making process in surgical procedures on the breast for oncological purposes. Methods: Twenty-seven experts were invited to partake into a Delphi Survey. At the first round they have been asked to provide a list of features involved in the decision making process (patient's characteristics; disease characteristics; surgical techniques, outcomes) and comment on it. Using text-mining techniques we extracted a list of mono-bi-trigrams potentially representative of decision drivers. A technique of “natural language processing” called Word2vec was used to validate changes to texts using synonyms and plesionyms. Word2Vec was also used to test the semantic relevance of n-grams within a corpus of knowledge made up of books edited by panel members. The final list of variables extracted was submitted to the judgement of the panel for final validation at the second round of the Delphi using closed ended questions. Results: 52 features out of 59 have been approved by the panel. The overall consensus was 87.1% Conclusions: Text mining and natural language processing allowed the extraction of a number of decision drivers and outcomes as part of the decision making process in surgical oncology on the breast.
